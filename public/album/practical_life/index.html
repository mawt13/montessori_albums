<h1 id="practical-life-rationale">Practical Life Rationale</h1>
<p>The practical life area is of paramount importance in the primary Montessori classroom.  The work with the practical life materials and the attitude towards the work sets the tone for the entire classroom community.  E.M. Standing states that there could be no other occupations undertaken by children at the primary level (ages 3-5) which could be more important for the development of the three-to-five-year old’s whole self: physical, intellectual, and social-emotional/moral (Standing, 213).  Despite practical life setting the foundation for the children’s development and participation in the classroom community, many parents and even some guides misunderstand the importance of this component of a Montessori classroom. Despite the term “practical”, this component of the classroom helps a child grow and flourish developmentally and sets the foundation for growth in all developmental domains.</p>
<p>Although it is true that the practical life area contributes in many positive and practical ways to the child and classroom community, there are far more important reasons for this area of the classroom. The objectives addressed and skills learned through the practical life area are a direct aid to life, as Maria Montessori discusses education should be.  Children’s whole development is aided by the practical life exercises/work.  The specific order/procedure to be carried out for each practical life work assists in building children’s executive function as well as the ways in which the challenges of the various works of practical life progress from easier to more difficult and build upon one another.  In addition, through the work of practical life, children develop their sense of order, concentration, coordination, and independence.</p>
<p>Lessons in grace and courtesy are crucial to setting the tone in the classroom and preparing children for working together as part of the classroom community. Montessori guides provide direct instruction in the areas of grace and courtesy as opposed to assuming children will learn merely through the modeling and correction by the guide/older students.   Lessons include how to sit at one’s rug or in a chair at the table, how to roll and unroll the rug one will work on, how to move gracefully throughout the room without interrupting the work of anyone else (and thus, avoiding the designated working space of others), and many more activities many adults and teachers neglect to directly teach children.  This promotes the concentration of all in the classroom, as children learn to avoid interrupting the work of others.  Lessons also include how to open and politely/gently close a door, how to greet visitors, and how to solve conflicts peacefully.  These lessons are directly taught to the students, as an aid to their full (and polite) participation within a community, and always “(taught) by teaching, not by correcting” (Standing, 219).  As Maria Montessori has said, “In a word, there is no action which we do not try and teach so as to approach perfection.  We leave nothing to chance” (Standing, E.M. 216). These lessons are taught as prerequisites for other work within the classroom, for a child has to know skills such as carrying and unrolling a rug prior to being able to complete other works on one.</p>
<p>Through their work in the areas of practical life, children develop their will.  They do this through having the choice of which work to participate in. In addition, they learn to self-regulate through the independence given to them and learn to control their impulses through the lessons of grace and courtesy and through developing their concentration.  The lessons of grace and courtesy provide direct instruction in respecting others and the environment.</p>
<p>The building of a child’s concentration and sense of order through their work with the classroom materials, including those in practical life, helps a child become normalized/self-regulated.  This normalization process is a necessary precursor for success both inside and outside of the classroom.  Dr. Montessori describes various deviations/abnormal patterns of development and contrasts these with the normalization of the child, which can be aided with order (of the guide, family, and environment).  Of not-yet normalized children, Dr. Montessori wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only untidiness, disobedience, laziness, greediness, selfishness, quarreling, naughtiness, but also so-called creative imagination, delight in stories, attachment to persons, submissiveness, play…imitation, curiosity, inconsistency, instability of attention, disappears.  And this means that the nature of the child…is a mere semblance masking an original and normal nature…If normalization comes about through a determined and single fact, especially the concentration on some activity of movement, which brings the child into relation with external reality, we must suppose that a single fact lies at the source of all deviation, viz. that the child has been prevented from fulfilling the original pattern of his development, through some action affecting his environment at the formative age, when his potential energies should evolve through process of incarnation”  (Montessori, The Secret of Childhood, 131).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast, characteristics of the normalized child, which are promoted through the work of the practical life and through the ordered environment, sequential presentations, and work of the Montessori classroom include: love of order and work, spontaneous concentration, an attachment to reality (as opposed to fantasy), love of silence and/or working alone, no longer being possessive, acting from real choice as opposed to merely out of curiosity, obedience, independence and initiative, self-discipline, and joy (Standing, 175-178). Montessori states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>without work (the child’s) personality cannot organize itself and deviates from the normal lines of its construction.  Man builds himself through working.  Nothing can take the place of work, neither physical wellbeing nor affection…deviations cannot be corrected by either punishment or example.  Man builds himself through working, working with his hands, but using his hands as the instruments of his ego, the organ of his individual mind and will, which shapes its own existence face to face with its environment.  The child’s instinct confirms the fact that work is an inherent in human nature; it is the characteristic instinct of the human race (Montessori, The Secret of Childhood, 155-156).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through their work with practical life materials, and especially when given the three-year cycle in the Montessori classroom, children can become normalized. The practical life works, which involves deliberate and purposeful movement, naturally fulfill the child’s need to engage in synthetic movement, (movement ordered and directed by the mind to an intelligible purpose) (Standing, 214).  Children work with the materials with great purpose, following the sequence of steps involved in each task, and using their bodies and materials in directed, purposeful action.  This serves to build the child’s sense of order, as well as their physical and mental coordination and concentration.  A sensitive period for developing /refining the synthetic movements (of which the practical life lessons are endowed) occurs during the years of three to six.  Though these movements (and the synthesis, grace, and poise required for them) may pose a challenge at first, with enough practice, they can become habitual, and children can gain self-confidence through the process of these once difficult movements becoming more habitual.</p>
<p>The lessons in the Montessori curriculum build upon one another, so children must be taught preliminary exercises prior to engaging in work with materials which build upon the preliminary exercises.  The skills gained through preliminary exercises are needed for children to be successful in the tasks of subsequent exercises/lessons. Examples of preliminary exercises include lessons in grace and courtesy, such as carrying, rolling, and unrolling a rug prior to working with any other materials in the classroom, as well as dry pouring as a preliminary exercise to pouring with water/wet materials.   The sequence of the practical life work is important, as each work builds upon prior work.  Children must have a strong foundation in the more basic works of practical life (or any area of the classroom) in order to successfully build upon them.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular play-based ideologies, where the emphasis is solely on the child’s involvement with their play, no matter the ends, Montessori classrooms emphasize precision, order, and discipline (Standing, 220) and contain indirect and direct aims within.  Guides are to aid children in developing and refining their natural drive towards precision, order, and discipline (best addressed in the sensitive periods for this in a child’s primary years) as well as ensuring that children absorb/address the indirect and direct aims of the lessons.  While the direct aim might be something as simple as blowing one’s nose with grace and courtesy, the indirect aim always involves order, concentration, coordination, and independence.   Guides should introduce a motive of perfection into the various exercises, such as moving without making a sound, or pouring without spilling. These aid in interest and motivation, as well as in helping the child work towards increased perfection/becoming increasingly self-reliant.</p>
<p>The lessons and skills of the Montessori classroom aren’t solely for the purpose of the end result, but about the means/procedures involved with the work, and the way the child refines and develops himself/herself through the works. Montessori guides break down the steps and movements involved in a sequence which they provide direct instruction in, always striving to move with grace and towards perfection in movement, thus allowing for children to develop an analysis for their movement(s).  This directs a child’s focus on their actions (and the precision and grace of those actions). The child can then focus on the proper sequence of those actions as well (which assists in the development of executive function as well as aiding them to complete a task).  “Process rather than product allows the child to work for the sake of the intrinsic joy that one has when one’s focus is on the movement and order of the activity, rather than the end result” (Bettman, 71).</p>
<p>Executive function is crucial as it helps individuals manage thoughts, emotions, and behavior and is a better predictor of academic success (and overall wellbeing) than one’s IQ.   Working on executive function skills increases one’s ability to self-regulate as well as helps to integrate the rapidly firing neurons in one’s brain (Harvard University).  The entire process of a child selecting a work, following the necessary procedure for completing the work, and then returning the work to its proper place in the classroom builds a child’s executive functioning.  Children can become increasingly independent in their work as well (and can learn to aid other students newer to the class as well).</p>
<p>Another way in which practical life activities are an aid to life for children is how they help children develop independence.  Children are taught how to help themselves as opposed to waiting on an adult (or older child) to complete tasks for them, such as brushing their hair, brushing their teeth, buttoning/zipping/fastening a coat, or tying shoes.  Being able to successfully complete these tasks not only contributes to a child’s independence, but their own self-confidence as they see all they can do for themselves and as they persevere in mastering tasks that once were challenging for them.</p>
<p>The sequence of the presentation of lessons is important, as children will have gained skills through preliminary exercises, or prerequisites, such as grace and courtesy lessons of how to carry and unroll a rug prior to any other lessons involving working with materials on the rug.  These are considered preliminary exercises for the child to be capable and confident in prior to other lessons being given.  Another example includes having children freeze on cue: a preliminary exercise would be teaching the child(ren) how to walk on a line/walk in a line.  These preliminary exercises are necessary precursors to other lessons that build upon the lessons/skills involved in preliminary exercises.  The Montessori lessons build upon one another, and children must have a strong foundation in previous lessons to continue building upon/expanding their knowledge and skills in later lessons. The lessons of the Montessori classroom follow a specific sequence, allowing the child to construct him/herself through their work.  Preliminary exercises provide the necessary scaffolding for this process.</p>
<p>The various practical life exercises include isolation of difficulty as part of the presentation.  The guide analyzes what skill the child particularly needs to build/gain, then isolates this and provides concise, explicit instruction.  The lessons are taught in such a way as to focus on one major skill to be developed at a time, thus allowing the child to give that one skill their full attention, effort, and focus. For instance, when instructing the child in how to properly roll and unroll a rug, the isolation of difficulty is in the proper rolling/unrolling technique.  This is taught first, and separately, from teaching the child how to bring a material to the rug and working with it.  In teaching balance/posture and walking in a line, students are first taught how to walk on a line separately, thus the isolation of difficulty lies in balancing on the line. Guides must be astute observers and be mindful of which presentations a child is ready for and when.</p>
<p>Within each lesson/presentation are points of interest (which help intrigue the children and serve as a motivator).   For instance, in teaching children how to transfer small items with their fingers or tweezers, the child is developing and refining their pincer grasp (a necessary precursor for writing). The point of interest can be in the material being transferred as well as in the beauty or shape of the containers one is working with to transfer.  Varying these items from time to time helps the point(s) of interest remain interesting and inviting to the child.  Once the child has mastered transferring items with their fingers, tweezers could be given to add a point of interest/higher level of difficulty.  Thus the work can remain intriguing and inviting to the children, even with the passing of time.</p>
<p>The practical life area involves lessons and materials that are of great importance for each individual child in the classroom, as well as the classroom community.  There are many ways in which the way the child learns to complete the practical life work sets the tone for their participation and learning within the Montessori classroom and in all areas of life as well.  The practical life lessons build a child’s order, concentration, coordination, independence, and self-confidence, which prepare them for success in the classroom and in all of life.  When children spend three years within a Montessori classroom, they are given continued practice in the works of practical life, which all build upon one another and create enticing and developmentally appropriate challenges for the children, who are constructing themselves through their work with the materials in the classroom.  The work of practical life in the classroom is a necessary precursor for success in other areas within a Montessori classroom, and of paramount importance.</p>

<p><strong>UWRF Montessori TEP Director, Kateri Carver, PhD.</strong></p>
<p>The Practical Life rationale serves as a theoretical and methodological foundation for the contents of this album. However, there is some preliminary groundwork we want to share about Practical Life that functions as further justification for this area of the classroom. This is the secret of Practical Life that must be revealed because it is not immediately obvious in a compendium of lessons as is this album.</p>
<p>Before we begin speaking of the hidden global value of Practical Life, we state what it is not: Practical Life is not cute and frivolous! The impressions that might arise from an internet search about Practical Life which brings us dainty images or, Facebook Montessori groups that present  sweet finds from the thrift store, stand in sharp contrast to this curriculum area. Practical Life.  is a serious, important academic and social-emotional area of the classroom. While many early childhood teachers find great pleasure in finding just the right glass pitcher or organizational piece for their classrooms, we need to make sure we keep our eye on the direct aims of the lessons. The Practical Life area should reflect the children’s culture, the skills they need to be independent in their local environment and the Grace and Courtesy lessons that they need to practice to function in their classroom community and in their local community with dignity and respect for themselves and others.  For example, perhaps the child needs to learn how to screw the small plastic top on paper carton of milk. We can then, make a work that presents opportunities to support this fine motor skill using familiar, local materials.</p>
<p><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image005.webp" alt="Milk Cartons imgId-milk" title="imgClass--float-right"></p>
<p>Given contemporary discoveries in motor and brain development, we now know the profound, whole body, and lifelong benefits of Practical Life. At a glance, Practical Life may appear to be superficial and even whimsical because it incorporates aesthetic and functional principles such as color coordinated materials, visually appealing unique containers and finally, endearing child size versions of adult tools. Yet, all materials have direct and indirect purposes in the classroom; they should hold purpose beyond the immediately obvious. Practical Life meet the needs of physical, spiritual, motor and psycho-social development.</p>
<p>The scope of the Practical Life curriculum, expansive as it is, sometimes receives unequal attention. Fine-motor works, such as dry pouring or wet squeezing sometimes, unfortunately often overshadow the other areas of Practical Life. All areas of the curriculum are all equally important and need the same attention to rotation of works and careful design. The full inclusion of all the areas of Practical Life: Grace and Courtesy, Fine Motor, Personal Care, Care for the Environment, Food Preparation and Gross Motor will tremendously impact behavior management, normalization, and self-regulation among the children. Likewise, a Prepared Environment that is tidy, organized, and beautiful will truly be reflected in how the children interact with each other and the materials. Powerful!</p>
<p>Practical Life, especially what I refer to as “large Practical Life” is literally therapeutic. Occupational therapists (OTs) who treat various sensory integration disorders among other needs, have long endorsed the opportunities for “heavy work” in Montessori classrooms. While OTs are known in school settings for the handwriting and fine motor support, they also provide a whole area of therapy that addresses the processing of sensory and motor information. The development of sensory processing can come from activities such as carrying heavy objects, pulling or pushing with resistance or using cross lateral reaching movements of the hands and feet.  Specific examples of Practical Life works that support sensory-motor processing include: carrying a bucket of water as part of a door washing activity; pushing on all fours a gallon jug of rocks along the line; raking and picking up leaves requires the coordination of the whole body. In addition to therapeutic nature of Practical Life in its ability to refine the motor and sensory systems, Practical Life provides spiritual and psychic contentment and satisfaction. The development of self-confidence, self-confidence and the life-long journey of self-control/regulation take their roots in Practical Life. The scope is both wide and deep.</p>
<p>The examples above of large therapeutic Practical Life works that incorporate gross motor skills and the processing of sensory information are not just as important as Fine Motor skills- too often the singular focus of Practical Life- they are more important by virtue of the fact that they precede fine motor development and address the integration of all eight senses, including the proprioceptive, vestibular and the sense of self.<br>
Your work is to make sure that you design, make available and integrate into your classroom the wide range of Practical Life works that respond to the integration of all the senses, the motor system and physical coordination. It is no wonder that the indirect aims of every Practical lesson are order, coordination, concentration and independence and self-esteem.</p>

<h2 id="are-montessori-schools-good-for-kids-with-sensory-issues">Are Montessori Schools Good for Kids With Sensory Issues?</h2>
<p>By Melinda Kedro</p>
<p>Children who are growing and developing while facing the struggles of sensory processing disorder need support from their parents and teachers to ensure a nourishing and appropriate learning environment. Montessori programs provide an ideal structure for a child living with SPD. Research different Montessori schools in your area, schedule school visits and observe various classrooms to understand what each environment would specifically offer for your child.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-sensory-processing-disorder">What Is Sensory Processing Disorder?</h2>
<p>Carol Kranowitz, author of The Out-of-Sync Child, defines sensory processing disorder as “inefficient neurological processing of information received through the senses, causing problems with learning, development and behavior.” Common symptoms of a child suffering from SPD include, but are not limited to, extreme sensitivity to slight sounds, severe sensitivity to light, frequent bouts of carsickness, intolerance of specific food textures and flavors, acute reactivity to clothing touching or rubbing on the body, agitation when being held or touched or constantly needing to be held or touched. SPD is a neurological problem that medication cannot fix. A family-centered approach along with occupational therapy that incorporates sensory integration techniques is a common method for treating a child with SPD.</p>
<h2 id="sensory-development">Sensory Development</h2>
<p>The development of the senses is a fundamental aspect to every child’s journey through the early years of life. Supporting a child’s sensory development improves energy levels and focus and assists the child with learning to self-regulate behaviors. Maria Montessori, the founder of the Montessori method of education, postulated that children primarily learn through absorbing sensory information from their environments. The sensory materials in a Montessori classroom support whole-brain learning, addressing the developmental needs of the whole child. These materials are especially beneficial to children with SPD because each activity isolates a specific sense. In addition, the Montessori teacher will have awareness of your child’s struggle with sensory integration and can adjust materials and lessons based on his specific sensory needs.</p>
<h2 id="the-montessori-classroom">The Montessori Classroom</h2>
<p>Children with SPD respond positively to a predictable daily routine and sense of order within their environment. The Montessori classroom is designed to facilitate structure, organization and fluidity of movement. The classroom is a prepared environment where every activity serves a specific learning purpose, every material has a designated space on the shelf and behavioral guidelines assist children with developing functional independence. The orderly atmosphere of the Montessori environment will help a child with SPD feel more secure and comfortable. The Montessori philosophy for education also recognizes that every child is unique in their developmental needs. The teacher tailors the curriculum and methodologies to the individual needs of each child, making this a premium choice for a child with SPD.</p>
<h2 id="practical-life-activities">Practical Life Activities</h2>
<p>Some children with SPD struggle with proprioceptive dysfunction, which is difficulty understanding how one’s body is positioned in space without visual clues. Signs of proprioceptive dysfunction can include uncoordinated movements, clumsiness, excessive jumping and bouncing, large motor development delays, constant rough play, incessant shaking of the legs and the constant need to be in motion. The Montessori curriculum provides practical life activities that allow children to engage in “heavy work” – putting their whole body into an activity with a focused purpose. Activities such as lifting and moving furniture for classroom use, sweeping, mopping, washing tables, scrubbing the floor, hammering, gardening activities, shoveling snow in the winter – these all support the child with SPD by providing ample opportunities to develop muscle memory and gross motor coordination by channeling excessive energy into a focused task.</p>

<h1 id="grace-and-courtesy-lessons">Grace and Courtesy Lessons</h1>
<h3 id="i-grace-and-courtesy">I. Grace and Courtesy</h3>
<h4 id="a-control-of-movement">A. Control of Movement</h4>
<p>That movement is vital to the development of a child has been proven time and time again by brain researchers. However, the act of moving is not synonymous with the control of one&rsquo;s movements. In Chapter 13 of Maria Montessori: Her Life and Work, Standing (1998) asserts, &ldquo;in every country children reveal a spontaneous impulse towards balancing exercises.&rdquo; They have an innate need to explore balance in order to master their own body and yet, according to Standing, &ldquo;Correct balance is difficult for the child for two reasons: first, because his muscular system is not yet perfectly coordinated; and secondly, because the weight of his head and body, in proportion to his legs, is much heavier than in the adult&rdquo; (p. 224). Walking on the Line and other balancing works are essential in helping the child to master his own limbs and to move with the precision and efficiency that he, himself, desires. Maria Montessori (1972) writes in The Discovery of the Child, &ldquo;of itself movement is something unrefined, but its value increases when one attempts to perfect it&rdquo; (p. 76). And later, &ldquo;analysis and the economy of movement are bound together: to carry out no superfluous movements in the attainment of a goal is, in brief, the highest degree of perfection&rdquo; (p. 86). Through a variety of Practical Life works, children learn to control and perfect their movements. Analysis of movement, in particular, creates a mindfulness in the child about each unique motion. These lessons build upon each other and with practice, children are able to move in their environment with precision and grace.</p>

<h5 id="balancing">BALANCING</h5>
<p><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image009.webp" alt="Balancing Kid imgId-" title="imgClass--float-right"></p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong>
Low balance beam, painter’s tape, or Velcro to make marks on the floor in a line. This can be one solid line or marks about 12 in apart. River stones may also be used.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>
none</p>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Preparation for subsequent Grace and Courtesy lessons.</li>
<li>Assessment of child’s ability to balance.</li>
<li>Assessment of child’s ability to follow both visual and auditory directions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indirect Aims:</strong>
Order, coordination, concentration, independence and self-confidence. Preparation for gross motor exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 3-5</p>
<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Invite the child to step on the beam, river stone, or the tape mark on the floor, with both feet side by side.</li>
<li>Ask the child to do as you do. Raise arms to shoulder height. Assess if the child does the same. Explain and show the child that moving one’s arms up and down helps keep balance.</li>
<li>Ask the child to take one step forward on the beam or to another river stone and then bring the other foot to meet it using their arms to help them balance. Notice if the child can take one step and stay in that position. Note the ease or difficulty of balancing.</li>
<li>If the child takes one step with ease, continue to incrementally increase difficulty of various steps to assess balance. For example, placing arms on the hips or by the sides increases difficulty. Ask the child to lead with the other foot or ask the child to hop with both feet small distances. If the child cannot take one step easily, continue to work on balance while standing still or with single steps, as appropriate.</li>
<li>Show the child how to slowly step off the beam or river stones.</li>
<li>Thank the child.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Points of Interest:</strong>
Gross motor activity; the balance beam or the river rocks. Arm movements.</p>
<p><strong>Control of Error:</strong>
The child (catching himself from falling).</p>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong>
Instead of using a beam or other equipment, simply ask the child to stand on one foot. Do assessments with balance, verbal and visual directions using only the child’s body.</p>
<p><strong>Extensions:</strong>
This activity can be done outside with natural materials. This work can include other gross motor and perceptual motor activities such as directionality (right and left), crossing the mid-line, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Vocabulary:</strong>
Stand, step, balance, beam</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Assessing language comprehension of terms is also possible and worthwhile to do during these balance activities.</p>

<p><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image020.webp" alt="Child Putting on a Apron" title="imgClass--float-right"></p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong>
Child-sized apron</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>
None</p>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong>

<p><strong>Indirect Aims:</strong>
Order, coordination, concentration, independence and self-confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 3-5 </p>
<p><strong><strong>Presentation:</strong> Putting on an apron</strong></p>
<p>(Typically, this lesson cannot be fully demonstrated by the adult as the aprons do not fit. However, consider having an older child demonstrate).</p>
<ol>
<li>Invite the child to the lesson.</li>
<li>Name the lesson.</li>
<li>Go the place where the aprons are kept or if at the work, take the apron.</li>
<li>Squat down low and open the apron on the floor. (How the apron opens differs depending on style and design, but it may include sliding off a holder [napkin ring, soft ponytail holder]; undoing Velcro so the straps fall open etc.). You can also unroll the apron on a table.</li>
<li>Unroll the apron.</li>
<li>Pick up the apron indicating the hole for the head. (Some aprons slide over the head and then the straps come forward and Velcro in front; others have elastic at the sides and the child simply place their arms inside and wriggles into it as they pull it over their heads.</li>
<li>If needed, show child how to secure apron closed- usually in front.</li>
<li>Thank the child.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Presentation II:  Taking off an apron</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Invite the child to the lesson.</li>
<li>Name the lesson.</li>
<li>Demonstrate how to unfasten the straps, if there are any.</li>
<li>Invite the child to remove it by sliding it over their heads. Depending on the apron, select the easiest method for the child.</li>
<li>Lay the apron on the floor or on a table.</li>
<li>If the apron is messy, invite the child to wipe with apron with a sponge or paper towel. (Or, the child can be invited to wash the apron using the washing works).</li>
<li>Roll the apron up following the design cues and fasten it closed (Velcro, napkin ring, soft ponytail holder etc.).</li>
<li>Pick up the apron and take it to the work or the bin where the aprons are kept.</li>
<li>Thank the child.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is a very good practice to teach children to wipe, clean and scrub aprons. This can be a similar lesson to the clothes washing lesson and greatly preserves the classroom aprons.</p>

<h5 id="freeze-on-cue">FREEZE ON CUE</h5>
<p><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image029.webp" alt="Bells" title="imgClass--float-right"></p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong>
Bell, singing bowl, or chime</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>
Walking in a line</p>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong>
Teach the children to stop, look and listen when the chime sounds</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Aims:</strong>
Order, coordination, concentration, independence, and self-confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 3-5</p>
<p><strong>Presentation I:  Introduction to freezing on cue</strong></p>
<p>This lesson is often given on the first day of school coupled with a tour of the classroom. It is repeated many times throughout the week to teach the freeze cue lesson, to instruct where the various areas of the classroom are and to name the areas. You may want to make sure you give walking in a line lesson beforehand.</p>
<ol>
<li>Invite the children to the Gathering place in the room.</li>
<li>Name the lesson.</li>
<li>Explain to the children that we don’t have to use words all the time. We can use of things to give messages.</li>
<li>Sound the chime. Tell them, “This means that you stop what you are doing, including working, talking, walking etc. and look toward the chime. Listen to the message that will be given and do what the message says.”</li>
<li>Invite the children to stand up.</li>
<li>Tell them that you are going to practice listening to the chime while walking silently.</li>
<li>Invite the children to walk in a line behind you.</li>
<li>Carry the chime out in front so the children can easily see and hear it.</li>
<li>Walk slowly and deliberately for about 5-7 steps.</li>
<li>Ring the chime and freeze. If needed say, “Freeze, eyes on me and listen for the message.” Otherwise, provide feedback about their freezing on cue in positive terms.</li>
<li>Invite them to walk some more. Weave a path around the classroom, stopping in important places such as the bathroom, hand washing sink, cubby area, snack table, etc.</li>
<li>At different time intervals (approximately 3-10 seconds) walk and then chime. Have the children freeze on cue when the chime rings.</li>
<li>Thank the children.
Presentation II: Stop, Look and Listen</li>
<li>Select a location within the children’s reach where the bell will reside all the time.</li>
<li>When the children are working, go the place where the bell/chime is kept.</li>
<li>Ring/ Chime the bell.</li>
<li>Pause. Wait in Silence.</li>
<li>Use gestures if needed, to make a freeze motion, to point to the eyes to indicate “eyes on me.”</li>
<li>If needed state the rules of the Freeze cue: Stop, Look and Listen to the message.</li>
<li>Make an announcement such as,” We will have group snack in a few minutes so finish up your work soon and please return it to the shelf what you found it.”</li>
<li>Thank the children.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When teaching the lesson to freeze amid work cycle in the early days of the school year, it is helpful to have a motivating/ engaging message such as snack, time to come and play a game at Gathering, time to prepare to go home etc. Once the children are accustomed to responding to the bell/ chime the messages can vary to include some redirection, needs etc. such as “It is getting loud in the classroom. Let us use our inside voices, today X is going to oversee chiming when needed.”</p>
<p><strong>Points of Interest:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The unknown time when the chime will ring</li>
<li>Visiting areas of the classroom and seeing the various works</li>
<li>The sound of the chime</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Control of Error:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Example of classmates</li>
<li>Sound (or lack of sound) in the classroom</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong>
Walk around the ellipse instead of the room</p>
<p><strong>Extension</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ask an elder to oversee chiming when leading others around the room.</li>
<li>Give lessons on how to ring the bell and/or how to chime.</li>
<li>Use the extended time of the chime to be the length of walking; chime, then walk to ringing and use hand to stop the sound and freeze in silence. Ring again and start walking.</li>
<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> though this is the opposite of the rule, Stop, look and listen, because they are not stopped, they enjoy this game and it serves the same need to train them to stop when the bell chimes/rings.</li>

<h3 id="ii-gross-motor-development">II. Gross Motor Development</h3>
<h4 id="a-introduction">A. INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>The word “gross” comes from French (gross/gross) meaning “large.” Gross motor development refers to the large muscles of body’s trunk (torso), arms and legs as well as whole body movements. To begin to understand gross motor development in children 3-6 years old, we must go back in time to the infant and toddler years. After acknowledging Alexis Carrel for stating that the first two years of life are the richest, Montessori goes on immediately afterwards to say in the Absorbent mind, “the first two years of life open new horizons before us, for here we may see the laws of psychic construction hitherto unknown. It is the child himself who presents us with these revelations” (p.5).</p>
<p>In order to understand gross motor development in the early childhood classroom we must look back briefly at motor development in infant and toddlers because this area of development marks their most profound self-construction work up to this point.</p>
<p>Watch this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPSAgs-exfQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPSAgs-exfQ</a>  to remember that all children start as infants.</p>
<p>Now, we go back even further.  One of the first ways a baby makes its presence known to an adult is through movement in the uterus. Though commonly referred to as “kicking”, it is simply the movement of the head, arms and legs against the uterine walls. These early movements are often described as butterfly-like flutters that begin to be felt by the mother around week sixteen. Finally, we also feel hiccups in utero when the baby starts to practice breathing! Movement then, is really the very first way we get to know a baby within the womb. Movement begins to show patterns, can be monitored and defines the baby development. Outside of modern medical advances such as ultrasounds, the baby’s movements in utero are the natural way for a baby to demonstrate development.</p>
<p>In the book, Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics (2009), Paul Lipkin provides some valuable basic information about the motor system and its development in his chapter entitled: “Motor development and dysfunction.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Motor development is typically subdivided into gross motor and fine motor skills. Gross motor development involves large full body movements, primarily involving the trunk and legs, and culminates during the aptly named “toddler” years with independent walking, climbing, and running. Fine motor development is centered on shoulder, arm, and hand use, with refinement of movement into small hand and arm movements such as the pincer grasp of late infancy or throwing during the toddler and preschool years. Delays in the acquisition of these skills result from slow or disrupted maturation of the nervous or musculoskeletal system, causing a spectrum of motor disorders. These motor dysfunctions range from mild motor coordination disorders to the more severe disorders of central nervous system–based cerebral palsy or peripheral motor system–based neuromuscular disease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contribution of authors Glen Aylward and Lynn Jeffries in the same pediatric compendium remind us how important it is to monitor motor development in the early years as it can be a key indicator for both mild and severe dysfunctions. Early interventions for motor development can make life-changing results. In their chapter on “Screening and Assessment Tools,” they note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Motor development of preschool-aged children is characterized by active movement throughout their environments and continued refinement of skills previously acquired. In the preschool years, motor skills become particularly important for social interaction and play. Children with motor impairments that limit their ability to explore and interact with their environment are at risk for delayed development in cognitive, communication, and social domains. Because most children with moderate to severe motor impairments have been identified as having delayed motor development or have a medical diagnosis by this age, norm-referenced discriminative measures are rarely useful, but other types of discriminative measures can be helpful for measurement of motor-related dimensions within ICF, such as range-of-motion (body functions/structures); mobility, and self-help skills (activities); and the child&rsquo;s ability to participate within family routines and community settings (participation).  [*ICF: International Classification of Functioning]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paying close attention, observing and documenting gross motor development (as well as the sensorimotor development) can profoundly inform our teaching and understanding of the child. Best case, we can document a delay and help with a professional intervention plan and thereby likely stave off future, more server complications in various other domains of development as mentioned above; worse case we can implement basic gross motor activities that through fun, individual or groups lessons can practice a skill. All mastery of gross (and fine) motor development can ONLY come from the individual practicing with their own body. Individual practice is the only path to mastery; adults can support emotionally and verbally and most importantly provide the Prepared Environment and the opportunity to practice but that is the limit of their contribution toward mastery.</p>

<h4 id="the-three-unknown-senses--but-so-critical-to-the-motor-system">THE THREE “UNKNOWN” SENSES – but so critical to the motor system</h4>
<p>It is well documented that Maria Montessori places extreme importance on movement both in her writings and the implementation of her methodology. Today, as a result of much research and technology, we know a great deal more about movement. Moreover, we now understand physiologically why she placed such critical importance on movement.</p>
<p>Understanding movement begins with acknowledging the presence and functioning of three typically “unknown” sensory systems within the body.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vestibular sense</li>
<li>Proprioceptive sense</li>
<li>Kinesthetic sense</li>
</ul>
<p>These three systems work together for the development of all motor skills.
The vestibular system, which maintains balance collects information critical for controlling movement and the reflexes that move various parts of our bodies to compensate for changes in body position. Both proprioception (perception of body position) and kinesthesia (perception of the body’s movement through space) interact with information provided by the vestibular system.</p>
<p>These sensory systems also gather information from receptors that respond to stretch and tension in muscles, joints, skin, and tendons (Lackner &amp; DiZio, 2005; Proske, 2006; Proske &amp; Gandevia, 2012).</p>

<td>Vestibular Sense</td>
<td>Sensory system that contributes to balance and the sense of spatial orientation.</td>

<tr>
<td>Proprioception</td>
<td>The sense of the position of parts of the body, relative to other neighboring parts of the body. Focuses on the body’s cognitive awareness of movement.</td>
<td>You step off a curb and know where to put your foot. You push an elevator button and control how hard you have to press down with your fingers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kinesthesia</td>
<td>Awareness of the position and movement of the parts of the body using sensory organs in joints and muscles. Kinesthesia is a key component in muscle memory and hand-eye coordination. It is more behavioral than proprioception.</td>
<td>You are aware of your arm movement while swinging a golf club. Focuses on the body’s movements and not on equilibrium or balance.</td>

<ul>
<li>Using a wide, deep planter or other tub, choose the type of loose material to put inside. Ideas include: safflower seeds; beans/legumes; bird seed; sunflower seeds etc.</li>
<li>The bean tub should be heavy, sturdy and large. A child should be able to kneel or squat and place one or both arms all the way in the tub, so the hands reach towards the bottom and the tub reaches their armpits.</li>
<li>Begin with the tub only about ½ way full of the loose item.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Invite one child to lesson</li>
<li>Name the lesson</li>
<li>With the palm of the dominant hand and trace the top/ opening of the planter or tub making a full circle around the top several times.</li>
<li>Slowly and deliberately plunge your hand into the loose material and manipulate it. Swirl slowly, pick up and then let it “drip back out” of the hand, cup the hand and left and then pour out; etc.</li>
<li>Show enjoyment of the sensation of feeling the loose material.</li>
<li>Tell the child; “All the seeds/beans need to stay inside. If some fall out, I will help you clean them up.”</li>
<li>Invite the child to try the work.</li>
<li>Thank the child.</li>
<li>Walk away from the work.</li>

<h5 id="wiping-bathroom">WIPING (BATHROOM)</h5>
<p><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image089.webp" alt="Adult Demonstration with Ballons" title="imgClass--float-right"></p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong>
Toilet paper
Wet wipes (optional)</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>
Hand washing or other person care lessons</p>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong>
Independent toileting habits</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Aims:</strong>
Order, coordination, concentration , independence, and self-confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 3-5 </p>
<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There is no uniform consensus, even within our own respective cultures whether this is a lesson that a teacher should or should have to do with a child. Best case, it will support a teacher who needs to help a child; worst case, it can be shared with a parent or adult care giver to show how to teach the child. The important take away is: the child needs a lesson and is not born knowing the proper and hygienic way to wipe the private areas of their bodies.
Also, teachers should neither demonstrate nor touch the child’s private area under any circumstances. All is verbalized (and possibly motioned) and feedback is given to the child during the process, so they know of they are following the proper procedures.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask the child to stand up and make sure the clothes on their lower body are with completely off (preferred) or around their ankles.</li>
<li>Show them how to take sufficient toilet paper and how to tear it off.</li>
<li>Show them how to fold it with two hands.</li>
<li>Show them to start in the front and wipe towards the back.</li>
<li>Adjust the direction and times according to need (urine/bowel).</li>
<li>Show them where to put the used toilet paper.</li>
<li>Remind them of the hygiene rules about touching bodily fluids and stool.</li>
<li>Optional: invite the child to take a wet wipe and wipe again.</li>
<li>Optional: show the child where to throw away the used wet wipe.</li>

<p><strong>Extensions:</strong>
Model on a large doll: “front to back”</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Typically, the easiest way to clean a child over 2.5 years old who has had a bowel movement in their underwear is to strip them down completely from waist down. Help them wash themselves several times with a basin of warm water and soap. Notify the parents/ family/ care give that the child needs bathing when the child is picked up. A helpful practice is to have towels, washcloths and a bathmat on hand ONLY to be used for accidents. These linens can be sent home with the child’s soiled clothes and washed by the family and returned. All soiled clothes and linens should be bound up in a zip lock plastic bag or similar sanitary closed container.</p>

<p><strong>Age:</strong> 3-5</p>
<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Often, children with various sensory integration issues can be very bothered by the fire alarm noise and thus processing the auditory information differently from normally developing children. First, become familiar with who these students are in the classroom. Second, warning them well ahead of time can help a great deal. Third, involving them in the alarm ringing process for example, going with the administrator to pull the fire drill can help since it reduces the surprise factor.</p>
<ol>
<li>Read books and talk about fires, danger, and procedures and practices to avoid fires.</li>
<li>Explain what a drill is; how often it happens and why the school has them.</li>
<li>Set up practice sessions when you review the rules, the exit plan and the expectations regarding indoor shoes, silence and where to line up outside.</li>
<li>On the day of a fire drill, be mindful to not have an activity scheduled that may distract the children from following their normal routine the exiting practice sessions they have had.</li>
<li>Some typical fire drill procedures include:
<ul>
<li>Once a month at various times of day (at least one during nap/ rest time).</li>
<li>Keep indoor shoes on.</li>
<li>Get up, leave work and put down anything in their hands and walk to the door and line up in silence and hands behind their back.</li>
<li>Adult 1 leads group to designated safe area.</li>
<li>Adult 2 gets attendance record, any medications (inhalers etc.), emergency bag (if school Emergency Preparedness Plan requires), checks all bathrooms and does a sweep around the room before turning off the lights and joining the class to take attendance.</li>

<p>Other dressing frames include safety pin frame, Velcro frame and overall buckle frame. For all frames, as with all Practical Life lessons, we do a thorough task analysis while interacting with the work in order to decipher the steps that are so commonplace or habitual to the adult. We practice executing the steps to make them succinct and efficient hence, practice on the material by the adult.</p>

<p><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image114.webp" alt="Sewing Supplies" title="imgClass--float-right"></p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Needle</li>
<li>Specific container (a plastic tube is ideal such as eye liner refills or for other small objects)</li>
<li>Threads (several kinds: embroidery; fabric, upholstery)</li>
<li>Threaders</li>
<li>Scissors (fabric scissors are marked as such in the sewing area/ works)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bead stringing</li>
<li>Lacing cards (large and small)</li>
<li>Cutting lessons (paper)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong>
Familiarize children with tools for sewing and potential hazards of each</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Aims:</strong>
Order, coordination, concentration, independence, and self-confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 4.5-5 </p>
<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Invite the child to the lesson.</li>
<li>Bring a lacing work to the table.</li>
<li>Bring thread, needles and fabric scissors.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast the lacing and sewing tools:
<ul>
<li>Lace vs. thread</li>
<li>Card vs. fabric</li>
<li>No needle (end of lace) vs. a needle</li>
<li>No scissors vs. fabric scissors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explain the importance of using fabric scissors for thread and fabric and not on paper. Mark the fabric scissors clearly. These are for the adult to use.</li>
<li>Demonstrate cutting some different kinds of threads and fabric with fabric scissors</li>
<li>Take the needle container and demonstrate how to open it. Take out a needle and explain the parts of the needle and names.</li>
<li>Count the needles in the container. Tell them that we always need to know if they are all there or being used.
<strong>NOTE:</strong> I have found that the easiest way to manage needles is to have a limited and counted number of needles available. This allows both children and adults to check to see if a needle has gone astray – a dangerous situation. If needle is missing, stop all sewing work and find the needle with the children. Often on the floor!! Remind the children that the work will be REMOVED from the shelf until the needle can be recovered.</li>
<li>Using a threader, show them how to cut a piece of thread, place it in the threader and slide it through the eye of the needle.
<strong>NOTE:</strong> it is often easiest to have children double the length of the thread and tie it at the bottom for their early sewing with needle and fabric. This prevents the thread from coming out of the needle. Later, when they are ready, they can get a lesson on pinching the needle over the eye so as to hold the thread in place when only a short leader piece (3 inches or so) is through the eye.</li>
<li>Double the thread (see above Note in #9) and knot it at the bottom. You may or may not have taught them how to knot. Many times, in sewing, we have to support the children by tying the knots for them as this is very challenging, but we do not want that challenge to prevent them from advancing in their sewing. They will amaze you, I promise!</li>
<li>Practice poking down and pulling up several times. Show them how, making sure their fingers are out of the way and how to hold the fabric in hand sewing.</li>
<li>Thank the child.</li>

<p><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image115.webp" alt="Child Sewing a Button" title="imgClass--float-right"></p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Large button with 2 or 4 holes</li>
<li>Felt or other fabric squares about 4”x 4”</li>
<li>Optional: strips of felt long enough to make a bracelet (very popular)</li>
<li>Thread</li>
<li>Threader</li>
<li>Fabric scissors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>
Sewing tools lesson</p>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong>
How to sew a button</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Aims:</strong>
Order, coordination, concentration, independence, and self-confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 4.5 - 5 </p>
<p><strong>Presentation:</strong> lesson for the square (lesson for the bracelet below). This lesson has lots of detail, comments and remedies for frequent struggles because children LOVE to sew, and these steps are the foundation for all sewing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Invite the child to the lesson.</li>
<li>Name the lesson.</li>
<li>Choose a thread color and cut the thread lone enough to double the thread for knotting at the end.</li>
<li>Thread the needle and knot at the end.
<figure class="float-right"><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image116.webp"
         alt="Sewing a Button Closeup"/><figcaption>
            <p>Secure the thread in place with the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> knot as a stop. Note thread is doubled and knotted at the end.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>First, secure the thread in the felt where you want the button to be (near the edge is easier for the child to hold).</li>
<li>Choose a button.</li>
<li>Slide the button on the needle and pull the thread all the way through.</li>
<li>Holding the button with the thumb in place, explain and show the TOP and the BOTTOM as you turn the felt and button over to show the underside and topside.</li>
<li>Take the threaded needle and start on the top. Choose one hole and poke the needle down about halfway through the hole. Stop. Turn the felt over and show the child the needle sticking through.</li>
<li>Caution the child NOT to place their fingers right under the holes or they will poke themselves.</li>
<li>Take the needle from the underside and continue passing the threaded needle through to the end. The hand holding the felt square should be turned so the bottom/ underside is very visible.</li>
<li>With a good view of the underside, show the child how to “hunt” – poke up with the needle – for the hole of the button from underneath and checking on top. This takes trial and error but will improve with practice.</li>
<li>Once a hole is located, poke the needle halfway through and stop. MOVE THE HAND FROM THE UNDERSIDE TO THE TOPSIDE.</li>
<li>Take and pull the needle and thread all the way through to the end.</li>
<li>Repeat by going back down a different hole, reaching under to grab and pull it all the way through. Then, find a hole and COME UP from the bottom into a hole. Transfer the hand to the top and pull the need and thread all the way through.
<ul>
<li>The most frequently occurring challenge most students have is NOT remembering this easy rule: if the thread is on top, you POKE DOWN from the TOP; if the thread is on the bottom, you POKE UP from BOTTOM. Wherever the thread is located is the side you poke from.</li>
<li>If a child does not follow this, then the thread gets wrapped around the side of the fabric. The solution is to cut, knot next to the fabric. Knot the thread at the ends again and start again from the bottom (so as to hide the knot).</li>
<li>The second challenge is that the needle comes unthreaded. However, as mentioned above and seen in the picture, this can be prevented by doubling the thread and knotting the ends after the needle is threaded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continue until the button is securely attached. Cut thread and knot close to the felt.</li>
<li>Thank the child.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Presentation II:  Bracelet</strong></p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Invite the child to the lesson.</li>
<li>Name the lesson.</li>
<li>Choose a thread color and cut the thread long enough to double the thread for knotting at the end.

        </figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Choose a strip for the bracelet.</li>
<li>Thread the needle and knot at the end.</li>
<li>First, secure the thread in the felt where you want the button will go. Not too close to the edge but the strip must overlap over the child’s wrist so the buttonhole can be cut into the felt and still be lose on the wrist.</li>
<li>Choose a button.</li>
<li>Follow all the same as above.</li>
<li>After button is secured. Cut thread and knot close to the felt.</li>
<li>Buttonhole: carefully mark where it should be. Fold the end back where the hole should go and snip once in the center of the fold. Unfold and see the line/ opening. Err on the side of a small snip first; it can always be enlarged.</li>
<li>Adjust buttonhole as needed.</li>
<li>Thank the child.</li>

<p><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image130.webp" alt="Sewing Examples" title="imgClass--float-right imgClass--half-size"></p>
<p>There are countless sewing projects that the students can do that use the same skill set as making a pillow. For example, make a small sachet that is about 4”x4”. Instead of using stuffing, use shredded lavender soap; not much is needed soap is needed for the scent to be emanated. Make sure to close tightly (close running stitches) as well as the final closing seam. Sewing projects are particularly wonderful gifts to give for holidays, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day etc.</p>

<h5 id="gardening">GARDENING</h5>
<p><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image163.webp" alt="Child Gardening" title="imgClass--float-right"></p>
<p><strong>No specific lesson will be given here since:</strong>
Garden varies so much from school to school and more importantly, there are so many geographic, seasonal and even budgetary factors to consider.</p>
<p>However, gardening is the great equalizer and brings tremendous spiritual fulfillment and delight.  A few notes and tips below:</p>
<p><strong>About Materials: As few as possible:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gloves: in general, not needed. If the child is tactile defensive, gardening is therapeutic to reduce sensitivity and wearing gloves when digging in the dirt only perpetuates a hyper or hypo sensitivity.</li>
<li>Shoes: Old rubber boots are a good solution for gardening at any time of year. Build a classroom collection that everyone shares.</li>
<li>Tools: Actually, using the hands to dig, pull weeds, pick flowers, pick up leaves etc. allows the children the engage with nature more sensorially and, ensure direct contact with the natural world which has been proven to have profound emotional benefits and academically advantageous.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips for Gardening:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Plant fruits, vegetables, herbs and flowers that they can see grow, eat and/or work with in various ways.</li>
<li>Make it available to the children as often as possible. Include all aspects of the growth cycle into the classroom: when it is too cold to plant outside, start seedlings inside in a window.</li>
<li>Avoid having gardening be a large group or adult-run activity.</li>
<li>Make choosing a gardening work just “another” work.</li>
<li>Bring the outdoors inside. For example, make a mortar and pestle work of grinding dead dry leaves! Studies show that children who learn, identify, interact with and are responsible for their local plants and animals are much better stewards of Earth than those who learn about far away land and species that are endangered.</li>

<p><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image165.webp" alt="Richard Louv Quote"></p>
<h4 id="a-general-information">A. General Information</h4>
<p>Preparing food in an early childhood (EC) classroom has many benefits and applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration of the Practical Life skills of Fine Motor, Care for the Environment and Grace and Courtesy</li>
<li>Contribution to healthy eating and understanding of nutrition</li>
<li>Ability to easily connected to Culture and Math</li>
<li>Directly connect to snack and meals in the classroom</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three main components to food preparation in the EC classroom:</p>
<ol>
<li>Snack Routines (set up, eating and clean up)</li>
<li>Individual works of food preparation (orange juice squeezing, cutting an apple etc.)</li>
<li>Baking and Cooking (special occasions, Culture studies and/or other)</li>
</ol>
<p>Below we will give information and/or lessons for these three main areas. Like Gardening which also has infinite options, the Food Preparation description will offer typical Montessori routines surrounding food and eating, provide suggestions and communicate the fundamental importance of learning to prepare one’s food.</p>
<div class="spacer-div"></div>
<h5 id="snack-routines-group-and-individual">SNACK ROUTINES (GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL)</h5>
<p><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image166.webp" alt="Snack Time" title="imgClass--float-right"></p>
<p><strong>A. Group snack for the start of the year and special celebrations:</strong></p>
<p>Usually, at least the first 2 weeks of class, the EC classroom may or may not have group snack. The transition to individual snack is when most of the children are ready – only the guide will know when that occurs!</p>
<p>Group snack will be demonstrated during In-Residency. Some of its characteristics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A chime is rung, and snack is announced.</li>
<li>Coming to the line.</li>
<li>Sitting crossed legged and hands on the lap.</li>
<li>A handwashing / cleaning routine (this can happen before coming to the line). A gracious way to clean hands is with Japanese towel service. The guide brings to gathering a tray with rolled, moist towels and a set of tongs.  Each child cups their hands above their lap and awaits to be served. The adult tongs to each child a moist white towel (literally, a washcloth).  The towels are collected with the laundry basket one by one. Individual towel service can then be done for group snack on special occasions.</li>
<li>A student walks around the exterior of the circle and passes the napkins/ paper towels/ paper plates to each child to put the snack on.</li>
<li>A lesson on how to unfold the napkin or a statement of the expectation of where the napkin/paper towel goes and how is given.</li>
<li>A tray of all the snack items that the Assistant/ Guide is brought to the center of the gathering.</li>
<li>The tray has food items in serving dishes with tongs/ spoons to serve.</li>
<li>The adult looks around and sees “who is ready”: sitting still, napkin ready and minding any other stated expectations.</li>
<li>The adult serves the children one by one (random order makes it a game and easier for all to wait).</li>
<li>Each child waits with their snack in front of them until ALL children are served.</li>
<li>Then, at the cue, saying, song prompted by the guide, the children being eating.</li>
<li>The Assistant/ Guide serves water and passes to the children.</li>
<li>The Guide demonstrates the expectation for cleaning up the napkin. i.e.  folding up the edges to catch the crumbs and then to await the person who goes around the circle on the outside with a trash bin.</li>
<li>Children are dismissed from group snack one at a time to return to their work or get a work.
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Group snack requires all food to be prepared and portioned ahead of time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Individual snack at a small table:</strong></p>
<p>Individual snack is a hallmark of a Montessori classroom. Often two or three students stop their work, serve themselves and sit down and eat snack together. In order for this to take place, several elements need to be put in place. The elders in the classroom are the best helpers for showing how to have individual snack.</p>
<p><strong>Setting:</strong></p>
<p>Typically, in or near to the Practical life are of the classroom, there is a table with chairs. Often, this table will be different from the other worktables and will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tablecloth</li>
<li>A vase of flowers</li>
<li>A place to put their name cards</li>
<li>Perhaps a table trash depending on the menu</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Food and Serving:</strong>
Typically, one of the adults is responsible for the food in the classroom. They make the selection of food, prepare/wash/ cut the food items. The food is placed in serving dishes with tongs/spoons/ forks/ small scoop for serving one’s self.</p>
<p>The Adults selects a card that has the numeral and the quantity for the food. The card is placed in front of the serving bowl, so the children know how many to take. These cards can also have dots (adhesive circle labels) to show the quantity for students who do not yet know the quantity associated with the symbol.</p>
<p>Procedures and more:
Some classrooms chose to have children wear specific fabric aprons only for the snack table. Also, the procedures of plates and clean up needs to be determined ahead of time. Children often place their dirty plates in a dish bin filled with soapy water. Sometimes the children wash them at the washing stand.</p>
<p>A system must be established about who gets to have snack and when. A convenient means is to have a set of name cards for snack. When they want to have snack, and the table is not free, they put their card there to show that they are waiting. Only one set of cards can wait at a time.
Some classrooms choose to have a waiting chair if one is waiting to eat. Soft sounding timers are sometimes helpful in the snack area if many are waiting their turn.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong>
Individual snack not only takes planning on a daily basis but also for its commencement as a regular classroom routine. When this starts, group lessons are given to demonstrate, explain and state expectations.</p>
<p>Finally, some children simply need more food than others. It is best to follow the child and ‘let go’ the situation of a child taking more than is indicated.</p>

<h5 id="individual-food-preparation-lessons">INDIVIDUAL FOOD PREPARATION LESSONS</h5>
<p><strong>A. Works on the shelf:</strong></p>
<p>Even though the class may start off the year with group snack, many classes go ahead and start individual food preparation works because they are both so enjoyable for the children and function as a preparation for individual snack.</p>
<p>After this introduction are several individual food preparation lessons. These can be on the shelf at any time of year and may or may not be connected with / related to group and/or individual snack.</p>
<p>One of the principal rationales for providing individual food preparation lessons is that the children learn to serve. Serving food becomes the model for all service. Serving others allows for the practice of generosity, humility and kindness. This is just an example of why Practical Life lessons were dubbed earlier in this album as “deep and wide.”</p>
<p><strong>Serving others takes three forms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Peers: take a serving to a friend (see lessons below).</li>
<li>Teacher/ Assistant: take a serving to a teacher/ adult in or outside of the classroom.</li>
<li>Guest: take a serving to an observer/ guest/visitor.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="baking-and-cooking">BAKING AND COOKING</h5>
<p><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image167.webp" alt="Child With Tray of Cookies" title="imgClass--float-right"></p>
<p>It goes without saying that most children love to participate in cooking and backing activities. These times provide excellent teaching moments for measurement, science, grace and courtesy as well as nutrition. Below are some tips &amp; suggestions for cooking and baking with children:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not underestimate their ability to contribute and participate. I have seen 3- and 4-year old’s do a work of peeling many cloves of garlic, slicing them, (tasting them!)  and happily pouring them in the vegetable soup. This task kept three children completely engrossed and concentrated for one full hour!</li>
<li>Be very clear and firm with expectations: if you do not want to them come closer to a frying pan, put a piece of tape on the floor and tell them ‘they can watch the crepe making from behind this line.’ If anyone steps over the line, stop cooking and tell them we will try again another time.</li>
<li>Give group lessons on the ingredients and teach them the science that goes along with the food. They can learn new terminology such as ‘dairy’, ‘wet ingredients’, ‘sifting’, root vegetables etc.</li>
<li>Be clever and plan ahead. If the recipe calls for three cups of sifted flour, pre-measure the exact amount of flour before you give it to them to measure and sift. Divide one step into multiple steps:  If a recipe calls for several grated carrots, create 3 grating carrot works for 3 groups of 2 children. This way, 6 children are assigned to one item in the recipe.  Elongate the process: instead of just peeling a carrot or potato, wash the carrots first, then peel, then slice. It can take all 25 children, 2 adults a full three-hour work cycle to make one large pot of vegetable soup if the work is divided and planned.</li>
<li>Children will likely eat what they make:  try unusual recipe like zucchini bread, bran muffins and remember butter makes everything taste great. And, they can make their own butter too. See lesson below.</li>
<li>Cooking and baking with the elders: allowing the elders to feel special encourages them to embrace their role of responsibility. If the classroom follows a routine of the 3rd years to stay until at least 3 pm, the afternoon time is perfect for cooking. The group is usually smaller, they are older and more responsible and there can be more connections to the other areas of the curriculum because they have seen and done more of these lessons.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="special-occasions">SPECIAL OCCASIONS</h5>
<p><img src="http://example.org/img/practical_life/image168.webp" alt="Leaf Time" title="imgClass--float-right"></p>
<p>Special friend breakfast:  invitations, individual tables, ceramic/ china plates, flatware, linens, flowers, coffee, tea and fruit kabob and pastry. Extremely endearing to the parents and friends.
Fall harvest dinner: soup and bread. Class dinner for bread and soup made by the children. All families are invited, all eat a meal together. That’s it!
Halloween breakfast: school wide breakfast of bagels, oatmeal and fruit so parents and children can see all the costumes.
Holiday cookies: children make cookies and serve at holiday gathering with songs and handmade gifts.</p>
<p>Each school has specific celebrations. So many other options!</p>
<p>Remember, it all starts by modeling. If you bring a watermelon during the first weeks of school for group snack and prepare it and serve it to them, they will learn from you how wonderful and fun it is to prepare food and serve others.</p>

<h2 id="class-notes">Class Notes:</h2>
<h3 id="practical-life-day-1-notes">Practical Life Day 1 Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Need to get practice hours with materials….</li>
<li>Oral exams on Friday….On Wednesday, we will pick about ten of the lessons…we will practice our specific one on Thursday; we will pick one to present on Friday…..</li>
<li>Practice Logs: Need ten practical life practice hours…can have ten hours over the course of your program….Someone at school can sign off on our hours….aim for an hour a day….</li>
<li>Begin the year with focusing on carrying rug, unrolling rug, rolling rug, how to sit in a chair</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="intro-to-practical-life">Intro to Practical Life:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Practical life is an introduction/foundation for the classroom: Grace and Courtesy so we can work well with one another….after that, it’s focused on how to share space…gross motor, fine motor, care of self, care of the environment</li>
<li>Cornerstone Montessori Classroom video:</li>
<li>“Education not something teacher does, but is a natural process we flows from the human being” Montessori</li>
<li>Cornerstone is the most diverse school in Minnesota</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical is basic,, useful, purposeful</strong></p>
<p>Why is practical life important?  Why do we do it?  How can we do it?  It’s for everyone..many young adults don’t know how to do basic life skills….70% of adults don’t know how to sew on a button.</p>
<p><strong>Four areas of Practical Life: (foundation for entire classroom)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Preliminary: basic movements, pouring, folding</li>
<li>Applied: (care of environment and self)</li>
<li>Grace and Courtesy: graceful interactions with others, grace in movement</li>
<li>Control of Movement: walking the line</li>
<li>Direct aim for every Practical Life=order, control/coordination, concentration, independence (OCCI); (Very few things in Montessori have products at the end)</li>
<li>If children are dysregulated, have them wash their hands, have them scrub a dirty tire, have them work with water….helps their focus…it helps them transition to the academic areas</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Characteristics of PL:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reality-based: wash dirty dishes with real soapy water, cut fruit with real knife…there is safety in reality</li>
<li>It’s not limited….they are limitless as they depend on the cultural environment needs which vary from environment to environment</li>
<li>There is one of each on the shelf (very occasionally you can do two): this helps the child learn they have to wait and life is not about immediate gratification; materials become more valued….can have table scrubbing, shoe scrubbing, apple cutting, banana cutting, carrot cutting…but you would never have six carrot cuttings out…indirect aim is learning how to wait/take turns (Emotional Intelligence)</li>
<li>Can have three different spooning activities: one in open container, the other in a slightly less open container, the other in a closed container that the child had to open</li>
<li>Can have tongs, spooning, etc. available for different containers/different foods</li>
<li>Pouring with grains, rice, water with funnel, water without funnel….many pouring activities that are all different</li>
<li>Pouring without handles, then pouring with handles, pouring and stopping…..new isolation of difficulty with each one</li>
<li>Separation of materials and how you should have brass polishing over here and how kids walk across the room to go polish brass….(Joosten article)…there’s a point to have things close by one another, but there’s a point for walking across the room</li>
<li>Have wood polish set up, brass polish set up…they’re purposeful for the environment, not stuck to the tray</li>
<li>More Characteristics:</li>
<li>Self-contained (if it’s on the tray)…can bring it all to where you need it/table scrubbing tray to table</li>
<li>Complete…needs to be complete (pink tower needs ten cubes: learning about base of ten)</li>
<li>Location of materials easy to get to…wouldn’t put things up high where they can’t be reached</li>
<li>Sequential</li>
<li>Color-coded (apple cloth on a red tray); Orange juice on orange tray, aprons and mats you protect the table with are those colors: helps with culture because everything is color-coordinated</li>
<li>Manageable container: don’t want anything too wobbly that can tip over easily</li>
<li>Functional, child-sized</li>
<li>Proportional items (pitcher pouring into small enough container)</li>
<li>Natural materials!  Pour beans and rice! For tonging and tweezing too!</li>
<li>Want items that are easily cleaned, safe, and orderly</li>
<li>Glass, beautiful, natural materials</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="most-important-characteristic">Most Important Characteristic:</h4>
<ul>
<li>P.L. activities should be representative of child’s culture/daily experience: if children don’t have windows, there should be no window cleaning exercise</li>
<li>Make sure activities are appropriate to the culture of the children here and now</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do You Make Practical Life Appropriate to Students you are teaching?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Colored sand and dirt or little rocks to pour in Head Start classroom instead of beans and rice</li>
<li>With water, change out the pouring utensil to keep interest level maintained….</li>
<li>Add fragrance to the soap: Mrs. Meyer’s soap added to water to scrub tire, etc.  Have the same old soap in different colored/designed bottle….Have handwashing in different colored bowls with different towels to bring interest in it (everything color coordinated)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Art Activities:</strong> sewing, beading,</p>
<p><strong>Movement:</strong> book: Montessori Matters, bean bag, rolling pin in a circle, movement cards</p>
<p><strong>Trauma and Practical Life:</strong>  ACER scores are higher ….</p>
<p>Clay….kinetic sand….bubble popper fidget things….(can find at Five Below)</p>
<p>Need to crochet, knit, etc….braiding (they can make their own sitting spot)….Sticks with strings that come down, can use like a loom; knitting and crotching can be meditative: even weaving with weaving boards….should have food in the classroom for cutting, serving, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Idea:</strong> Food prep on one whole shelf…top shelf could have orange juice squeezing, apple cutting, strainer for orange juice squeezing, half a banana for banana cutting: on top shelf would be all the food choices, underneath would be all the materials for you to choose what you wanted to do with the food….you could just have one tray with all materials on one tray: pouring milk into cereal….</p>
<p>OSHA wouldn’t allow silver polish…(can use toothpaste as a substitute for polish…put it in a jar with a lid, they can use a toothpick in it)….</p>
<p>Have outdoor area freely accessible…..</p>
<h4 id="gross-motor">Gross Motor:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vestibular and Reflex Integration (for toe-walkers, etc)….. can do rocking (lay on back, knees up, pushing the child by their knees), washers on your feet (feet going inward, then outward): Kazinki: if they fan toes, their reflexes haven’t been integrated….for children it’s a lot of work to get integrated</li>
<li>Try the knee pushing thing with Noelle</li>
<li>Cones that are stepping rocks you can stand on (puts pressure on the sole of your foot)…can walk on like river walks/integrate into classroom</li>
<li>Walking the line also works in gross motor-can use Velcro strips to create the line….(adhesive can cause issues with the carpet)-(can use sit spot circles to walk from one to another-no adhesive)….</li>
<li>Something to do while walking the line: bean bag on head, pinball on spoon, etc.</li>
<li>Movement Shelf: dice with things like hop on one foot, push up, etc.  and then a number di, they roll at the same time and to the amount of movement they roll….</li>
<li>Four or five movement works and some peace works (alongside?)</li>
<li>Balance Beam: (could just have students walk the line with strip on floor)</li>
<li>“River Rocks”-have depth to them, can push differently against the foot, gives some stability and sensory input….</li>
<li>Carrying: Always use two hands, hold it close to your body, after a few weeks of practicing you could hold it incorrectly and ask them what you’re doing incorrectly</li>
<li>Always model the expectations…..</li>
<li>Rules for the students should be the same for the teachers, otherwise you’re unintentionally establishing hierarchy</li>
<li>Every lesson in the portfolios must have a picture: need to show children how to unroll a rug</li>
<li>When you roll a rug, test it to be sure it’s rolled tightly by seeing if it can stand….needs to be rolled tightly to stand</li>
<li>Can place out three rugs and practice walking around them with other children….sit next to the rug and place work on the rug</li>
<li>Montessori Services have rugs in two sizes…..(Ikea has rugs like this, too=$2)….</li>
<li>Have assigned jobs (like line leader) ahead of time, avoids the fight/anticipation….can have a day when child can bring in something (like oranges), or flowers</li>
<li>Conflict management: you can ask the victim, “Do you accept their apology?”  They may not, you can ask, ‘What can ____ do to help fix this?”</li>
<li>For early reading, can make clear e(s) for silent e(s), helps child know the e helps the vowel say its name</li>
<li>Rolling the rug, walking carefully around others’ work, etc. = important to introduce at beginning</li>
<li>Gross Motor development helps children integrate some of their reflexes</li>
<li>Prepared Environment: Environment is beautiful, functional, all materials have their proper place; guide is calm, centered….guide creates culture of the classroom/set the tone and energy of the classroom….pay attention to what permeates their space through you</li>
<li>Grace and courtesy and practical life lessons pivotal</li>
<li>Could make a canvas with a line/labyrinth for children to walk prior to entering the classroom</li>
<li>Montessori presentations/lessons are often White-centered…the idea of not interrupting is more of a White-European centered concept…how to make these culturally appropriate?????</li>
<li>There might be too little oral language in Montessori classrooms….have a conversation table available….children from lower socio-economic environments who have been talked to all day have much broader vocabulary</li>
<li>Need to allow children to be engaged in more dialogue…build oral language into the environment</li>
<li>There can be social learners (not just visual, auditory, kinesthetic, etc.)…you can have natural social learners…follow the child where they’re at, including their culture</li>
<li>A Black woman once was upset by children walking with hands behind their back, as she felt like this practice was “a school to prison pipeline”…..maybe change this….</li>
<li>Represent cultures currently</li>
<li>Montessori says the best ages of education are in the Early Childhood ranges…Cornerstone is the most diverse school in the state (is a charter school)…started with a stringent 1/3 total scholarship, 1/3 total pay, 1/3 partial scholarship…..three waiting list for a homogenous mix</li>
<li>Individualized, culturally-responsive…..</li>
<li>Montessori is truly for everybody…..we have to think about this, think about how we bring children of all socioeconomic and racial groups…Montessori schools in Minnesota are recognized as adaptations that help children’s learning</li>
<li>Be responsive to your culture….people feel familiar with what they know…some cultures find Montessori so oppressively quiet to some cultures….finding the balance between our expectations of quiet</li>
<li>Decentralize Whiteness and “First-class”-ness…..Montessori started out in slums of Italy, with children with special needs….</li>
<li>Converse with parents about what they want for children long-term</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="practical-life-day-2-notes">Practical Life Day 2 Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learning another language helps your brain build new neural pathways, etc.  (It’s actually great for people with dementia).</li>
<li>Logs for our hours: Keep running log in whatever style you like: Date, Name of Work, Time, Signature: Each class has its own page. (Log Grace and Courtesy Lessons for one hour).  -Walking the Line, Sitting at a Table, Carrying a Chair, Carrying a Tray</li>
<li>The Wheel of the Room: Practical Life, then Sensorial, then Math, Language, Cultural (in a circular shape that it flows from one area of the room to another)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-art-of-the-presentation">The Art of the Presentation:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Get yourself centered, pause and take a breath to be centered before you present</li>
<li>Modeling the energy you want children to bring to their work=the prepared adult</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gross-motor-1">Gross Motor:</h4>
<ul>
<li>River Rocks/Stepping Stones: rounded semicircle so the shape causes their bare feet to curl around it (Babinski Reflex=helps integrate it)</li>
<li>Integrating your senses can be very tiring for adults who haven’t integrated them….”Reflex Integration ____” (developed by a man in Austria): five different levels, by the time you finished all five levels, you were working with children with profound special needs…level 1 is what you might see in your classroom without needing special support</li>
<li>Sensory sacks, weighted blankets, etc. are helpful…..</li>
<li>At what point do you reteach children certain large motor lessons?  At what point do they become more of a distraction than helpful?</li>
<li>Kids that are spiraling need proprioceptive feedback: large hugs, tight stretchy sacks….</li>
<li>Julianne often had both the self-serve snack station and then as a group a collective snack that was more hearty, also collective meals</li>
<li>Walk the Line on way into the school/classroom</li>
<li>Hand-prints you can stick on the wall so children can push on them</li>
<li>SMART Moves (in hallway)?/Sensory Walks</li>
<li>Walk like a bear, like a crab, go outside and kick leaves, throwing a balloon in the air, balance rocks/balance beam, throwing a balloon in the air (gets head to go back/vestibular system); can tap a children’s toe with your foot to help bring them “back to their body”</li>
<li>Help children integrate their senses/”be in their bodies”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fine-motor">Fine Motor:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sensory Table in Regular Pre-K classroom: water, sand,</li>
<li>Children’s House level is individual work, building concentration, they may parallel play, but get into social play in 1st grade; the sensory table could be for just one child at a time, having to wait and be patient for others’-it can be taken to a place versus some big structure in the room</li>
<li>Wouldn’t put water in at the beginning: would do dry grasping, place things in it (like 10 pumpkins), so students can find them all and put them back…..</li>
<li>Use tweezers/tongs  in sensory table…..</li>
<li>Start with dry grasping work in sensory table at beginning of year; polished stones you can get at craft stores; change it out, flax seed</li>
<li>Don’t give two lessons at once</li>
<li>Before doing any pouring work, have a sweep up work, have a bowl of beeds that you spill out on table into a square template that happens to be the size of the hand dustpan</li>
<li>Have two “wipe up the spill” works: green for ground spills, brown for table spills: have a sponge to wipe up the wet, then a dry cloth to wipe up again</li>
<li>Cleaning the Easel Work  introduced before painting/using shaving cream on easel</li>
<li>Chalkboard washing introduced before introducing the chalkboard work</li>
<li>Cleaning the art mats  before art materials are introduced</li>
<li>Start with the clean-up work before the other Materials: don’t do snack unless you first teach pouring, napkin folding, etc.</li>
<li>Julianne has hung sheets over areas that are closed/turn thing around/take materials out at beginning of year; would have 2-3 shelves of just rug works: peg boards, bead stringing, lacing cards, etc. on a rug…..matching cards….most of the items didn’t need a presentation; called TRANSITIONAL SHELVES and they should be gone by November.  Practice rolling a rug, carrying a rug, etc….assistant does a lesson about playground equipment with ½ the kids, the others were having a lesson regarding how to choose a work, unroll the rug, work, roll the rug, return items, etc.  “You can only do the work you’ve had a presentation on”-slowly build on works that need presentations.  Then move into table works: have two shelves of table works that don’t need a presentation…show everyone pink tower, show everyone dry grasping….as soon as they had a presentation they could go right into it.</li>
<li>Bead Stringing: have big beads to medium beads to small beads (on transitional shelf)</li>
<li>Set-Up is very important; for students who have been there and nothing is new, it’s still okay to have a transitional week or two, but they are ready for stuff</li>
<li>May have to re-visit certain presentations with students who haven’t been working with them for quite some time</li>
<li>Have Kindergarten shelf still available…communicate to three-year-olds which areas of the room they can explore</li>
<li>Can have extensions for Kindergarteners like putting pink tower and brown stair together, combining them, etc.</li>
<li>Sandpaper Letters: skip sandpaper with older students, have them do a rainbow painting of the letters, saying their sounds, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fine-motor-continued">Fine Motor Continued:</h4>
<p><strong>Transfer Grasping Work:</strong> Grabbing little stones/fishbowl glass stones and putting them in another bowl</p>
<ul>
<li>Always start with container filled on the left side, moving it to the right side; then taught to move it back so you leave it the way you found it: must be from Left to Right (early reading) (Glass vase filler)</li>
<li>Finger grasping (purpose of such small bowls is that you can’t push your whole hand in the bowl)</li>
<li>Cutting work can go into collage area</li>
<li>Cutting work with strips of straight lines, curved lines, spirals (can have students place these pieces in envelopes)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Good store to go to in Cities: Ax Man (has buttons, tweezers, etc.)….go and see something that works for practical life)</p>
<p>Montessori Services sells little trays, have them all set up and color-coordinated-loose site (Restaurant Supply Wicker Basket (that are really actually plastic)</p>
<p>Exploration of material goes from free exploration, to fixed exploration, to free exploration again (could use patterning blacks as free exploration, then into animal shapes, then free exploration again),</p>
<p>Practical Life Shelves can be that dry pouring is on one side, wet pouring on another shelf</p>
<p>OR Practical Life shelf can be categorized/separated by the motion of hand you’re going to do</p>
<p>For hot water activities, have a one-cup coffee maker….can have children use this for oatmeal, and the children can grind cinnamon, grind nutmeg…can use this for tea</p>
<p>Every water work, every food prep work, every polishing work should have an apron to protect the child (yellow for bananas)-mats for table, first get the mat and the apron (2 aprons at dishwashing stand), one for banana, carrot, apple, and orange; polishing aprons are cloth, instead of vinyl, one at easel…Try to color coordinate these child-sized aprons</p>
<p>Pick up pouring utensils with right hand, but place order of steps from L to R</p>
<h4 id="practical-life-shelves">Practical Life Shelves:</h4>
<p>One shelf: Pouring Dusting, wiping prep</p>
<p>Second Shelf: Sewing and tools</p>
<p>Next Shelf: Boards of Education, screwdriving, etc. work</p>
<p>Last Shelf: Scrubbing (and wipe-up spills work)</p>
<p>Also, dishwashing stand, dressing board stand</p>
<p>Amazon: colored wicker baskets!!!!  (Washable)</p>

<p><strong>Idea:</strong> Acorn to Oak Montessori Preschool and Nursing Home Combined!</p>
<p>Buy hole punches for children:</p>
<p>Leave pitchers empty and let children fill with water.  (If you don’t have running water, can have a large community pitcher available)</p>
<p>Have tweezing, spooning, and tonging work in one basket (eventually) to let the child choose to use what they want to use for transferring</p>
<p>Can have the child baste water into little bottom of bath mat things (with suction cups)….have them suck it back up into the dropper to put back into the pitcher, then use the sponge</p>
<p>Soap saver Holder Suction Pads; Tub Treads</p>
<p>Amazon: science experiments for kids: has special squiggly shapes</p>

<h3 id="practical-life-day-3-notes">Practical Life: Day 3 Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ask children (after conflict): Are you okay?  What happened?  How did it make you feel?  What do you need now? (Support for healing)</li>
<li>Peaceful conflict resolution doesn’t necessarily need to happen right away….sometimes you can give children time to calm down/decompress….children can’t be in fight, flight, or freeze</li>
<li>Empower children to make: “I need statements”  “I’m really proud of you that you know what you need and you can tell me”….You can tell them, “This isn’t the time for this, we need some calming down first, but we will circle back to this”</li>
<li>“If every eight year old learns to meditate, you will wipe out war in the nation” Dalai Llama</li>
<li>When every child learns they are entitled to their own autonomy/own sovereignty, then we can wipe out things like war, intolerance, etc.</li>
<li>Restorative Practices!  =integral to Montessori….self-advocacy skills, reparation skills!</li>
<li>Practical Life Rationale and Importance: The most important area of the classroom (math, language, cultural, sensorial, and practical life); it’s the foundation for where we get settled/regulated; until the child is normalized, they need to remain focused on practical life skills….</li>
<li>Older children who are dysregulated get confidence-booster from spending time in the primary classroom, focusing on practical life, and being a leader/peer for the younger students….</li>
<li>Pay attention to when children aren’t focused on their practical life work but are just bored</li>
<li>Can do an extension for children beyond certain levels</li>
<li>For older students, practical life focused on food prep, so children don’t feel too old….tire scrubbing….or long sequence of activities</li>
<li>Children who need to work on pincer and who are older-can they have letters printed on the jewels/stones as they transfer them to add that other skill</li>
<li>Three-year-olds are needing to focus on practical life</li>
<li>Kindergarteners might still need the WORK of practical life….polishing items in the classroom,</li>
<li>Everyone’s personal rationale might be a little different/differently worded….focus on why this is important?  Why do we spend so much time here?  Why is this a focus?  Why is this where we’re coming from?</li>
<li>Rationales should be concise and include supporting research-maybe three pages (Patty clearly states to hit these three points)…..3-5 pages-goes in front of manual and states why it’s important, necessary</li>
<li>Oral presentation on Friday: We’ll look at different works we might be using for a presentation; we’ll know which one we’ll get on Thursday; Friday we get practice time before oral presentation, then discuss practical life area design/extensions and variations, and final album photos….thinks we will leave by 1:00….Next week Sensorial: four day week, won’t be here at all next Friday (unless you need practice time)</li>

<h4 id="fine-motor-1">Fine Motor:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pouring with pitcher with handle into cup without handles; use sponge to wipe up any spills=work on the shelf;</li>
<li>For snack, can have students have their own glasses that have the children’s names on them; have children wash them after they use it</li>
<li>For cold drink pouring, can have children muddle water, have children grate lemon and add lemon zest to it</li>
<li>Can have a glass bowl, water pitcher, sponge, bowl of grated soap…..place the sponge in the dry bowl, add a spoonful of grated soap, pout the water in it, squeeze the sponge-it takes just a tiny spoon of grated soap</li>
<li>Napkin Folding: Book idea: More Decorative Napkin Folding, can look up online on how to fold napkins into leaf shape, etc.</li>
<li>Can have napkin folding occur right before lunch/snack is going to be served</li>
<li>Color coordinate colors for certain areas</li>
<li>Have a little First Aid Tray with band aids, a little tea tree oil for disinfectant</li>

<li>Can get plates/dishes at Montessori Services</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="day-4-in-class-notes-practical-life">Day 4 In Class Notes: Practical Life</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prepared Environment, Teacher Mind (thinking about who needs what presentation, etc.); take the opportunity to sensorially explore how a child would approach a work</li>
<li>Children can end up using the colors of the Stamp game as a crutch…..sometimes we are assuming the child understands the concepts more than they do…interesting challenge can be presented with this when transitioning to more traditional mathematical operations</li>
<li>Presentations should be done one on one or in very small groups (2-3); do a few whole group presentations the first few days: focusing on rug works for the first five days, then after that, focus on two tables, two rugs as whole group presentations</li>
<li>You can give gentle reminders when a child is doing something like sit on their rug…can gently remind them to sit next to the rug….3 period lesson: keep giving the correct procedure….or if a child is carrying two things, “Oh, remember, we only carry one thing with two hands”</li>
<li>Apply for a fruit and vegetable grant?  Stock food prep work with partnering with local grocery store regarding food they are considering throwing….</li>
<li>Stand for mops and brooms, laundry basket to put dirty mops and sponges; dusters are in it’s own little white cube on the floor, next to a shelf like the dressing frames</li>
<li>Have a dishwashing stand/dishwashing bins set up on a table for all day</li>
<li>Possibly buy a wash board for rag washing</li>
<li>Color coordinate items based on area of the classroom?</li>
<li>Montessori Services!  (Amazon too):</li>
