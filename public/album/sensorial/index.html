<h1 id="sensorial-rationale">Sensorial Rationale</h1>
<p>The Montessori classroom is inviting and contains within a variety of materials developed by Montessori (or adapted from the materials developed by Edouard Seguin and Jean Itard).  There are a variety of materials and areas of development addressed through the child’s work in all areas of the Montessori classroom, of which the sensorial materials are of crucial importance.  Upon observing Montessori classrooms, many visitors are struck by the level of concentration and/or the amount of repetition children engage in while working with the sensorial materials.  The sensorial area of the classroom is beautiful and inviting to the children; the children’s concentration and engagement with these materials helps set the tone for their intellectual, social-emotional, and physical development and are an aid to children’s lives, as Maria Montessori believed education should be.</p>
<p>The purpose of the sensorial area is for children to develop and refine their senses through exploration and discovery.  Through the work in the sensorial area of the classroom, children are able to focus on one attribute of an object/series of objects, such as length, breadth, height, color, texture, weight, size, as well as various shapes, such as squares, triangles, circles, etc. (Stilling, 161-162).  Children are able to gain sensorial impressions which can be organized. Through their work with the sensorial area, children will observe, compare, differentiate, reason, solve problems, and appreciate and participate in the world. The skills obtained through the sensorial curriculum are important because “a full, varied, and ordered sensorial life is the best preparation for the higher life of the intellect in the years to come” (Stilling, 163).  The sensorial materials are “Keys to the Universe” helping the children grow in their knowledge about the world (Stilling, 165) and provide sensorial knowledge related to mathematical and scientific knowledge children gain through the years in the classroom.</p>
<p>The sequence in which the sensorial materials are presented follows this order: first, children learn to perceive differences and recognize contrasts through sorting activities.  Second, children will perceive similarities/recognize identities through matching.  After these, children can begin to discriminate between ends of a spectrum (such as showing children the lightest and darkest shades of a color and helping them to discriminate between these two. Third, the child is given materials and time to develop the skill of grading, which requires that the child be able to discriminate between minute differences between objects (such as the slight variations in weight of the baric tablets).  After this, children can be given lessons aiding their ability to recall the sensory perceptions, such as showing the child one color tablet at a table with the guide, then asking the child to find the exact color/shade at the table mixed with the other colors across the room.  Following this sequence, children are able to gradually refine their sensual perception and build upon prior experience/knowledge gained.  Though the lessons are gradually building upon one another in this way, no one sense is focused on prior to another sense, though the groups of materials worked with isolate one sense. Isolating the senses helps the child to focus solely on developing/refining that sense during the time of working with the material.  The sequence involves moving gradually from the least difficult progressing to activities posing steadily increasing challenges, thus allowing for the steady refinement of a child’s sensorial discrimination abilities.</p>
<p>Of this ordered sequence of the sensorial materials, and the way in which one isolates the sense to allow children to gradually refine their sensorial impressions, Dr. Montessori wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(The child) is already awake, and already has constant, countless relations with his environment.  He needs rather to bring order into the chaos, created in his mind by the host of sensations coming to him from the outside world…(He is) an ardent explorer of a world that is new to him.  And, what he needs, as an explorer, is a road (that is something which is straight and limited) which can lead him to his goal and keep him from wandering aimlessly about.  He, then, passionately attaches himself to those things, limited and direct in scope, which bring order into the chaos that has been created within him; and with this order, they provide light for his exploring mind and a guide for his researches (Montessori, The Discovery of the Child, 117).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sensorial area of the classroom promotes normalization in that children are motivated to work with the materials partially because of their beauty and interesting qualities. These materials captivate the children’s interest and motivation, and many children will repeat the cycle of work many times. The proper use (and ability to match, discriminate, grade, etc.) requires a child’s concentration, thereby enabling normalization.  The children’s concentration is aided in that the materials offer a wide array of sensorial exploration, as well as contain within a control of error which serves to help the materials be auto-educational.</p>
<p>The control of error also helps children identify mistakes (and move towards seeking correction/perfection through the mastery of the work, which itself serves as a motivator and retains the focus of the child).  The sensorial materials and the exploration in this area serves to unite the child’s mind and hand, thus helping to integrate the sensorially non-integrated child, which serves to help normalize a child as well. Children’s interest in the work with these materials can be aided in that there are often many variations and extensions to the sensorial lessons, adding to the challenge and intriguing quality of this area of the classroom.</p>
<p>The work with the sensorial materials allows for the child to develop and refine his/her ability to: observe, compare, differentiate, reason, decide, solve problems, and appreciate and participate in the world.  The direct aims vary based on the lesson and sense being explored/refined, but help children develop and refine their visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, baric, thermic, stereognostic, and gustatory senses.  In addition, the sensorial area of the classroom and explorations therein help instill in children a sense of self and sense of wonder.  Direct aims also involve: grading by various dimensions, such as by diameter, height, depth, heaviness, shade, texture, developing/refining the pincer grasp, and discriminating between objects based on particular characteristics.  Through their handling of the various sensorial materials which require moving to a different area to work with them (such as the pink tower, brown cylinders/brown stair, and red rods), children develop a sensorial impression of concepts such as volume, height, and length, which will enable them to more easily/fully attain this knowledge through future lessons, as they already gained the concepts sensorially. The sensorial impressions will leave an imprint on the child that will help them understand certain academic concepts more concretely as a result.</p>
<p>Of the sensorial materials, Dr. Montessori stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every series of objects, whether they produce sounds or represent different colors…is graded, so that there is a maximum and a minimum, which determine its limits, which…are fixed by the use which a child makes of them.  When the two extremes are brought together, they clearly demonstrate the difference that exists within the series and therefore determine the most striking contrast that can be achieved with the material.  A sharp contrast between the extremes makes their differences evident and arouses the interest of a child before he has even had a chance to use them (Montessori, The Discovery of the Child, 112-113).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Children gain independence and self-confidence through their work with the sensorial materials which are auto-educational and auto-correcting.  Through continued practice, children can notice the refinement of their senses (such as through the work with matching the tones of the bells).  This also allows children to gain a sense of self.  As the sensorial area of the classroom invites children’s exploration and discoveries, as well as draws children to the beauty of the materials, children’s sense of wonder can grow and flourish.   Guides can draw children’s attention to the beauty, order, patterns, and wonder within and outside of the classroom as part of the sensorial curriculum, allowing for the child to appreciate and participate in the world, and coinciding with their growing wonder.</p>
<p>Though my experience with Montessori materials is still limited, I have always been drawn to the sensorial materials.  I have purchased some for my children, including the bells and cylinder blocks, and I have had practice with the red rods and prisms/brown stair before.  I was aware of the ways in which the bells could be used mathematically in the Montessori classroom as well but didn’t see the way in which the red rods and cylinder blocks were related to the base ten system of mathematics, because the discounted materials I have used in my home didn’t address the base ten systems.  The ways in which exploring with the sensorial materials provide direct connections to later mathematic lessons is quite an exciting learning area for me. Seeing the ways in which the work with sensorial materials flows directly into mathematical and even science is inspiring and helps me love this component of the classroom even more.</p>
<p>The sensorial materials are an aid to children’s development and lives both inside and outside of the classroom.  In addition to the beauty and intriguing quality of the sensorial materials, they help children gain sensorial impressions of objects, such as an object’s height, length, shape, volume, and various other characteristics.  These help prepare children for scientific exploration and the mathematical concepts explored within the three-year cycle of the Montessori classroom.  The sensorial materials are beautiful, inviting, and highly important and valued in the Montessori classroom.</p>

<h2 id="sensorial-class-notes-day-1">Sensorial Class Notes: Day 1:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Can make your own tasting (gustatory) bottles with bottles from Amazon (1.7 oz) or eye dropper bottles for herbs from co-op</li>
<li>2 credit class….we will not be working in here on Friday….Thursday can be time to practice and oral lessons….wrapping up/cleaning up environment….heading out about 1:00 on Thursday</li>
<li>Sensorial is one of the main five areas of classroom: along with math, language, culture, and practical life (which is the introduction/gateway through…this sets the tone for every other area, permeates into all area)</li>
<li>Montessori believed all information came to brain through senses, so we wanted to fine tune those senses….Montessori recognized ten senses: baric (sense of weight), thermic (temperature), stereognostic (dimension), kinesthetic (movement), pain….also sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell</li>
<li>Also sense of balance, sense of time, spatial awareness, sense of awareness of someone being behind you</li>
<li>Trying to encourage sensorial impressions</li>
<li>Square of Pythagoras: at this age level, it’s just doing the sensorial impression, red, three greens, square green, and two rectangle…children lay out this pattern sensorially</li>
<li>Binomial and Trinomial cubes: just doing the work to get the sensorial impression, later on its a2 + b2=c2, the sensorial impression helps us understand the abstract later</li>
<li>For tactile exploration, we sensitize the fingers with a tray, sponge, and water….dip fingers on the top, wipe them on the sponge, now fingers are more sensitive to touch (for sandpaper letters, sandpaper globe, and touch tablets)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Only want to get the tips of your first two fingers (not thumb) wet</li>
<li>Begin with grace and courtesy, practical life lessons, then proceed to sensorial, Pink Tower/Tower of Cubes, Broad Stair, Rods of Length</li>
<li>Practical life varies by culture; sensorial is consistent across culture, these items stay out all year and can be varied with <strong>Extensions:</strong> starts with 2.5-4 year olds, want them to be able to discriminate, fine-tune senses for academics…noticing the difference in cubes helps child notice differences between a p, d, and b….</li>
<li>Most sensorial materials are done on rugs (because they’re big); practical life was often done on tables….</li>
<li>Sensorial pre-writing goes on a table, anything big and clunky goes on a rug</li>
<li>There’s no sensorial area in E1 classrooms, but there’s a big geometry component in sensorial…in E1 they have a math area and a geometry area; the sensorial area becomes the geometry area in E1</li>
<li>You will see base 10 everywhere: 10 cubes, 10 rods, 10 knobbed cylinders in each container…10 10 10 everywhere, engraining the sensorial impression of 10 because we are a base 10 system</li>
<li>4 and 5 year olds who have been with you for two years don’t need another presentation on the pink tower, but you’re three year olds need this….can present this at first as a group presentation….maybe in two groups so they can see it…can have children participate by getting one cube for you, etc.</li>
<li>Carry one thing at a time with two hands….even tiniest pink cube…..Could order red rods stained red, pink tower stained with pink, broad stair stained with brown stain….shows natural grain of wood first</li>
<li>Pink Tower: length * width* height are all different</li>
<li>Brown Stair=width and depth are different, they are all the same length</li>
<li>Length rods have two lengths the same, only heights are different?</li>
<li>Red Rods=have to look left and right to notice differences, helps cross midline….tons of extensions….</li>
<li>Montessori Print Shop has activity cards with extensions</li>
<li>Sensorial=very math related with base 10 and leading into geometry; also language based (big, little, biggest, littlest); every work has more vocabulary, long and short for red rods, thick and thin for broad stair, naming colors of fabric, also smooth and rough, also comparison language</li>
<li>There’s a lot of science based…refines ability to observe, differentiate, reason, and solve problems</li>
<li>Work with the cylinders on the table….it’s pre-writing, do everything pre-writing on a table…Constructive triangles on a table, because you trace the line=prewriting, sandpaper letters on the table as well……</li>
<li>You never want children to learn things incorrectly, because re-learning correctly is so much more difficult</li>
<li>Appropriate posture helps your brain function better/with spine sitting upright…getting the correct position=pre-writing….</li>
<li>Can make lapboards for students to hold in their lap to write on as they sit</li>
<li>Tummy time is important for children who haven’t integrated yet….can have children lay on stomach to write</li>
<li>For cylinders, you would take them out and return them in a L to R order….can show trying to put the smallest cylinder in left….these are similar to the pink tower and red rods….</li>
<li>Next group of cylinders would be green for knobless), these vary in diameter and height…..proceed from L to R with largest diameter on left…this one is more like broad stair, with thin and thick….</li>
<li>Many children will not notice depth errors in the wooden cylinders</li>
<li>Take out red cylinders one at a time, when you put them back in, they are all standing upright….grade these by diameter….red cylinders correspond with cylinders that differ in height and diameter….</li>
<li>Don’t take away the child’s ahas, let them discover it on their own….if you don’t show the child they can use the red cylinders in this cylinder base, they won’t ever do it….show one child how this works, and then it spreads like wildfire and they all can do it…..</li>
<li>Yellow cylinders go with second one, where littlest is short and thin, the biggest is tall and fat</li>
<li>Green=thick and thin?</li>
<li>Ikea has nice colored place mats to go with the colored cylinders</li>
<li>Extensions and variations with cylinders are practically innumerable….can work with one at a time, two at a time, three, four, can put colored cylinders in the wooden blocks (for the knobbed cylinders),</li>
<li>Show how the colored cylinders are put away with all cylinders standing</li>
<li>Can label the cylinders with the corresponding ½ circle of colored sticker that corresponds to the colored cylinders that match that</li>
<li>Knobbed cylinders, show one at a time, let students work with just those before presenting colored cylinders</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Knobbed cylinders, each individually, then add one more set each day</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For Knobless, have them work with only one box at a time, then explore putting them together</li>
<li>Can work with red, green, and yellow together, keep blue separate due to how different it is</li>
<li>Don’t put out extensions for pink tower and broad stair almost until holiday break</li>
<li>Place the box of cylinders on top of its cover when you’re working with them….</li>
<li>Montessori Outlet sells the full set of colored cylinders for $84.95</li>
<li>Colored cylinders practice horizontally first, it’s easier to construct the tower because you’re not dealing with balance; this helps get the order first, then the child can focus on building the tower</li>
<li>With broad stair, one can climb up it with their fingers….very first time you show it, don’t purposely place it together incorrectly; first presentation =quiet, but 2nd presentation you can talk about thickest, thinnest (broadest/narrowest)….be careful, students might really enjoy hitting the smallest one against the stairs…can show students how each block differentiates by the one smallest block/stair</li>
<li>A variation is to have the blocks upright, stack them that way….Stacking vertically requires them getting a chair to reach the top….</li>
<li>Ellen asked about child who wanted to build…maybe have blocks in the classroom for students to build with….or could tell them, “Okay, you have to show me that you can build with these the way I taught you first”</li>
<li>In culture area, master builder sets to make Tower of Piza, Russian Orthodox Spires, pyramid block sets….”I see you’re interested in building, have you built the____?”  Can have building items on transitional shelf.   (HABA sets)…Chinese Pagoda to the culture area, Russian blocks….put it out with the continent studies….</li>
<li>Transition shelf can include pattern blocks too…..kids may get stuck there….watch for this….don’t push them….give presentations on other stuff in the classroom, getting things in each area…..you make it more interesting and creative….around November if kids aren’t branching out much, a lot of that stuff goes away….find out what they’re interested in and do something along those lines</li>
<li>Could use clay for constructing caves….items to construct teepees….</li>
<li>Transitional Shelf: patterning boards, tanagrams, (still creating)….have Montessori materials be used more for the purposeful …</li>
<li>Montessori based her theories on Piaget’s teachings, going from one plane of development to another, our plane is going from Children’s House to E1….Knowledge, application, when you’re having students construct entirely on their own, it’s more advanced…</li>
<li>WalMart.com has Montessori materials…look this up….</li>
<li>Kathy Pearlman, Rainbow Sounds ($50)…all downloadable, color code, laminate, and cut apart, for low-level learners, all independent, when done with that can go right into WASECA</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Red Rods:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Carry one at a time, horizontally, to give the impression of weight…at first, their hands might not be able to reach all the way across</li>
<li>This is difficult for children….you have to lay them in the same direction to gauge which is longest…use tips of fingers on either end of the rod when you move it….kids have to be able to turn their whole heads….can measure with the rods the difference in length…don’t due that presentation right away</li>
<li>Can use red and blue rods for addition as well, because they make a basic 10</li>
<li>Extension: can make a spiral out of it, by going diagonally with them….have to be able to balance it…..eventually can balance the knobbed cylinders on each end….</li>

<p><strong>Discovery of the Child: “Chapter 8: Visual and Auditory Distinctions” by Maria Montessori</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The various series of materials show differences (developing children’s visual perception) in dimensions; the first having differences in only one dimension; the second having graduated differences in two dimensions, area; and the third demonstrating the difference in all three dimensions (138).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solid Insets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These are wooden blocks that are the same size and shape which hold ten cylindrical insets, which can be grasped with the pincer grasp on the knobs and placed in corresponding holes.  The first container has cylinders that only differ in height.  The second container has cylinders differing only in diameter.  The third has differences in both height and diameter.</li>
<li>Children only work with one set at a time, which allows for two others to be engaged with the other block with cylinders at the same time.</li>
<li>The cylinders only fit in one hole exactly…therefore, this has the control of error.  Any errors in placing the cylinders are visually obvious, as well as the fact that there will be a left over cylinder that doesn’t fit in a corresponding hole, etc.  “(The child’s) attention is brought sharply to bear upon an obvious problem” (141).</li>
<li>“The three series of insets, which are at first indistinguishable from each other, reveal their least differences to a child who uses them, and all three create an increasing interest in a child as he learns how to use them.  There naturally follows as the result of the repetition of this exercise a sharpening of the eye in making distinctions, a greater keenness in observation, and a greater attentiveness in carrying out a systematic operation; and this in turn stimulates the reasoning power, which notices and corrects its errors” (141).</li>
<li>Mario M. Montessori has since developed a fourth solid inset and changed the name to cylinder blocks…this new cylinder block set is opposite of the third in Dr. Montessori’s original set and the cylinder with the smallest diameter has the shortest length.</li>
<li>The Blocks cover three systems: the system  of rods and lengths (the red rods), the system of prisms, and the system of blocks (142)  The red rods only vary in length and due to their length, handling these requires the movement of the child’s whole body.</li>
<li>The prisms (which are dark brown and I have referred to as the Brown Stair) are all equal in length, but have graduating heights (cross-sections).  They are arranged next to one another from the largest to the smallest height, resembling a staircase (144).</li>
<li>The pink cubes (pink tower) diminish in size and are stacked from largest on the bottom to the smallest on the top.  Children can pick up the blocks with one hand, stretching and strengthening the muscles in the childrens’ hands.</li>
<li>Through the use of these materials, children can develop a muscular memory for definite graduations of space (146).  Children’s arms have to be very steady when stacking the pink cubes to form the tower and the child must focus on the task.</li>
<li>The sense of sight benefits from the use of the above materials</li>
<li>If children use the three (or four) solid insets/cylinder blocks together at the same time, all mixed together, it adds an increasing level of difficulty to the work.  Children must recall to which series the cylinders belong (147).</li>
<li>“A child earnestly applies his intelligence to the task before him and carries out those naturally pleasing efforts of which he is capable” (147).</li>
<li>The eye is exercised in recognizing the various sizes (and differences) of the blocks, in discovering errors, which allows the eye/mind to recognize any errors and the hand is involved in correcting the error(s) (147).</li>
<li>Motor activity is involved in the way the children carry or grasp the materials</li>
<li>“The exercise of the senses is, therefore, carried out by movements which are directed towards some tangible goal.  This movement, with the help of observations already made, assists a child in concentrating upon the repetition of an exercise” (147-148).</li>
<li>The ten red rods relate to the numerical system in representing 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. to 10.  The ten prisms (brown stair) all correspond to the squares of the numbers 1-10…12, 22, 32, etc. to 10).  The pink cubes represent 13, 23, 33, etc.  Although the child only appreciates these varying proportions by his senses, his mind is trained in the basic data that prepares the way for mathematics (148).</li>
<li>Children tend to find the exercises where the differences are the greatest (most significant) are the easiest (like the pink cubes) and the exercises with the most minimal differences (like the red rods) the most difficult (148).</li>
<li>“In (the child’s) elementary classes, when he takes up arithmetic and geometry, he will again have an interest in the blocks of his early childhood, and he will restudy them according to their relative proportions with the help of the science of numbers” (148).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Color Materials/Chromatic Sense</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The original color tablets were made of wound threads of brightly colored silk, with doublefaced ridges around their edges so they could be handled without touching the thread</li>
<li>The nine colors chosen have seven different grades of intensity, creating 63 colored tablets.  The colors are: grey (from black to white); red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, brown, and pink</li>
<li>First, the colors in their brightest shades are picked out, red, blue, and yellow…a double set is placed near and the child is invited to match them.  Gradually, the number of colored tablets shown to the child is increased, until he can match all nine colors.  Then, the dullest colors are presented (148).</li>
<li>Next, children are given 2-3 tablets of the same color but of different intensity (shades), one the brightest, one the darkest, and one in between.  They must be arranged according to their shades (150).</li>
<li>Then, the various shades of the different colors, such as red and blue, are placed all mixed up before the child.  He has to separate the two series and arrange them according to intensity (shade) (150).</li>
<li>A group game can be played where the guide and a few children sit together, the children are each given a distinct color from the series, then all of the colors are mixed around them.  Each of the children then has to grab the gradations of their particular color, stacking them up (150-151).</li>
<li>One can have all but one color placed in their graded order on the table, and in a different area, show the child the one color you have, and ask the child to choose one from the table that is a similar color.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sensorial Knowledge of Geometry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first sets of insets of geometrical shapes that were made were made of two flat pieces of wood, one on top of the other, the lower being solid but the upper with different shapes and figures cut into it.  Within the hollows children could place the corresponding wooden shapes (151).</li>
<li>Each shape to be inserted is given its own single frame (152)</li>
<li>Examples of insets: square, rectangular, circular, triangular, trapezoidal, oval….Wooden containers were made to keep these groups together (152-153).</li>
<li>On the first tray are six triangles.  On the 2nd tray, there are a square and five rectangles of the same height but diminishing width.  On the 3rd tray are six polygonal shapes ranging from five to ten sides.  The 4th tray has six circles of decreasing diameter.  The firth tray has various curved figures, such as an ellipse, an oval, a floral design, and a curvilinear triangle.  The 6th tray has two trapezoids, a rhombus, and a parallelogram.  To supplement this are cards of shapes the children can match the solids to.</li>
<li>“As a matter of fact, a child devotes a great deal of energy to this exercise.  He must recognize the shape of an object and examine it at length.  Many children at first only succeed after several attempts in putting the pieces in their proper places” (156).</li>
<li>After 3-4 successful attempts at recognizing and correctly placing the geometrical figures, a child can advance to exploring the shapes methodically…children can touch the edge of the shape with their index finger as well as the edges of the frames that hold the shapes…this should become habitual to the child</li>
<li>“There can be no doubt that an association of the kinesthetic with the visual sense is of great assistance in the perception of shapes and in the fixing of them in the memory” (157).</li>
<li>Children are then given cards with the shape on them and must place the solid shape on them.  He must place the shape on the card exactly, so as to conceal the 2-D shape under the 3-D shape, then trace around the edges again.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercises for Distinguishing Sounds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Training in hearing must begin with silence as it departs from immobility to go on the perception of sounds and noises caused by movement” (159).</li>
<li>Silence is an important aspect of sound perception, as it becomes a controlling factor in the voluntary restriction of the movements that give rise to various sounds (159).</li>
<li>“Silence is also a means of procuring collective efforts, since in order to obtain it, everything, or everybody that it embraces must be completely immobile” (159).</li>
<li>Attempting to create silence creates quite the interest in children…</li>
<li>We can also train children to hear better by training the senses to the appreciation of the least auditory stimuli (159).</li>
<li>Itard worked with people who were half deaf and helped them perceive softer ans softer sounds through training</li>
<li>Help children differentiate between sounds and noises (this can be done with the human voice and with musical instruments)</li>
<li>Eventually children can be taught to distinguish tones (notes) of the musical scale, through the use of the bells</li>
<li>Four classes of sounds: silence, the human voice, noise, and musical tones</li>
<li>One material is two sets of wooden boxes, each containing wooden cylinders that produce graduated noises…children can match those from the blue-lid-covered box with those from the red-lid-colored box</li>
<li>The bells are all mounted on a different stand and students can sort match the notes of one set to the other pre-ordered set.  Once the child’s ear has been trained to recognize and remember the various notes and their order on the musical scale, he can order the notes simply by the scale, eventually being taught the names of the notes once he can accurately distinguish them (162).</li>
<li>Eventually half-tones of notes (flats and sharps) can be added….</li>
<li>“The exercise of the sense provides a necessary foundation for a musical education.  A child who has engaged in such exercises is eminently prepared for listening to music and can make more rapid progress in it” (162).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Silence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For true silence, there is a need of immobility, a suspension of life for a moment.  “Silence consists in the suspension of every movement and is not, as it is generally thought to be in schools, a suspension of the din added to the ordinary noises tolerated in an environment” (162).</li>
<li>“Silence can be positively understood as a state transcending the ordinary run of things…a momentary check requiring an effort, a straining of the will”( (163).</li>
<li>“A command would never be able to produce the marvelous union of wills in checking every act in a period of life when movement seems natural and irresistible.  And this collective action is attained by the very children who have been accustomed to act on their own account in their quest for inner satisfaction” (163).</li>
<li>Children can be taught silence.  Guides can attract the attention of the children to themselves as they become silent.  Then, a child can be called to join in the making of silence…then other children can be called, until the whole class has been together creating this silence, the cessation of noise</li>
<li>“The children, after making these efforts and experiencing the joys of silence, were like ships sailing into port.  They were happy about everything, about having something new, about having won a victory” (164-165).</li>
<li>Dr. Montessori once brought in a sleeping baby and noted out loud to the children  how quiet the infant was, how soft her breathing, and called the children to imitate the silence of the sleeping infant</li>
<li>“Even children feel the poetry of the silence of a tranquil, new born human life” (166).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judi Bauerlein’s TEDTalk on “Montessori=Creativity Unleashed”:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Splintering light”= those moments when a spark of light touches an internal awareness; it illuminates and moves on, but something in us is stirred…creates wonders</li>
<li>Changed through her Montessori journey…Maria Montessori had many moments of illumination and they did create wonders</li>
<li>Two years after she graduated as Italy’s first female physician (in 1896), she became involved with young children-thank goodness…asked to visit an institution of young children, called “idiot children” and treated as such…noticed children picking up pieces of bread from the floor and feeling it…The guide disgustingly said, “These children just ate, and yet they want more.”  Dr. Montessori said, “They don’t want to eat the bread, they need to touch it, to manipulate it.  They need sensorial experiences”</li>
<li>This brought powerful awakenings that a critical, essential need for each human is to be able to manipulate with their hands, to use their hands…”Give nothing to the mind until you first give it to the hand”</li>
<li>Her passion/belief in importance of sensorial experiences gave a strong basis for her educational system</li>
<li>Wall Street Journal Article published on 4/5/2011: “The Montessori educational approach might be the surest route to joining the creative elite, which are so overrepresented by the school’s alumni that one might suspect a Montessori Mafia”-What is it about a Montessori education that does foster creativity?</li>
<li>Some people who attended Montessori Schools: Jeff Bezos (CEO Amazon); Julia Child (chef, author, TV host); Yo Yo Ma (violinist, 15 grammy awards, actor); Beyonce Knowles (nominated for 16 Grammys); Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Nobel Prize winning author); Sean “Diddy” Coombs (Rap singer, actor); Devi Shridhar (youngest Rhodes scholar ever, Berkeley, CA); Joshua Bell (world renowned violinist); Sergei Brun+ Larry Page (founders of Google); George Clooney (Award-Winning Actor); Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; Will Wright (creator of Sim City); Jimmy Wales (co-founder of Wikipedia); Alice Waters (founder Chez Parisse)</li>
<li>Montessori environments create such inventiveness</li>
<li>Montessori colleague said they do encourage creativity, but most importantly they don’t stifle it.</li>
<li>Whole age span of Montessori environment from infancy through adolescence</li>
<li>A developmental cornerstone of Montessori education is the prepared environment</li>
<li>The classrooms are bright, beautiful, harmonious, greeted with genuine warmth, feel safe…materials arranged beautifully on shelves, plants and an animal or two or more are an integral part of the environment</li>
<li>“Everything is lovingly and carefully prepared to honor the work of the individual”</li>
<li>Sean Diddy Combs, rap singer and actor, attended public Montessori school…expressed beautifully, “I felt like I was nurtured into being someone special”</li>
<li>Dr. Montessori talked about the role of the prepared environment so the voice of the inner teacher within the child may be heard and independence gained…”it is as if nature safeguarded each child from the influence of adult reason in order to give priority to that inner teacher”</li>
<li>Many principles in the Montessori education but two which most effectively encourage and animate that teacher: freedom of choice and freedom to stay working with the material until one is satisfied</li>
<li>“The child in a Montessori classroom is free from the judgment by an outside authority that so annihilates the creative impulse”</li>
<li>Ex: 7-year-old choosing to work with Multiplication Board, doing the 6* tables…rushed over to bead cabinet, took the corresponding 6-bead chain and exclaimed, “They’re the same thing”</li>
<li>Student interaction with the sensorial material engages their complete concentration of both mind and body</li>
<li>Children can become so immersed in their work that they do lose all sense of time.  They experience deep enjoyment and creativity.</li>
<li>Similar to what Csikszentmihalyi describes as Flow in his book “Flow: The Psychology of Human Creativity”</li>
<li>Dr. Montessori has very specific requirements for this sensorial material: They had to be sturdy, well-constructed, mathematically-accurate, and pleasing to the senses because they must be worthy of the work that they will do for the self-construction of the individual</li>
<li>Montessori graduates have carried the sensorial experience into adulthood…explore different patterns with materials, combining materials to make incredible structures (pics of red rods used to assemble a maze-type thing, a pink tower among other materials assembled around it)</li>
<li>Children are young engineers who are building these incredible things; all because they have the time and choice to do so</li>
<li>Montessori graduates who have carried these sensorial experiences with them: Julia Child said, “My Montessori experience taught me to love working with my hands, to try new things, and have a very friendly relationship with error.”  Will Wright, creator of Sim City, said, “You learn really complex things in Montessori, things like the Pythagorean theorem by working with the material called the Trinomial cube…it’s all about learning things on your own rather than having teachers explaining stuff to you all the time…Simcity comes right out of Montessori.”</li>
<li>Nature education and cosmic education: the wonders of the universe: Very perceptive people have said how incredibly important it is that we have a warm and trusting relationship with nature and how sad it is when that sense of wonder is lost</li>
<li>Consider, in his influential book Last Child in the Woods by Richard Louv, he coined a term called nature-deficit disorder, describes what is happening with many of our young children and conditions such as: obesity, ADD, depression, among others…then points to research showing a healthy, happy childhood directly corresponds to healthy, happy connections with nature</li>
<li>Dr. Montessori said, “How sad the soul of man, especially that of a child who is not put in contact with nature”-She was determined to do something about this.  In her educational program, nature is included in every single thing, in curriculum, in environment, in nature walks, in camping….secondary students spend a long time tending the land…(picture of a secondary Montessori student who has created and is now building a straw bale house)..</li>
<li>Gabrielle Garcia Marquez, Nobel Prize winner, said, “I do not believe there’s a method better than Montessori for sensitizing children to the beauties of nature and for awakening their curiosity about the secrets of life”…This Viennese architect Freidensreich Hundertwasser said, “My Montessori school taught me to have an affinity for vivid colors and to love nature”</li>
<li>Cosmic Education begins at age six: that’s when Montessori observed, as we all know, the children of that age want to know the how and the why of everything…if that is what they need to feed their brilliant minds, it is our jobs to give that to them.  Our task is to enthuse them to their inmost core by planting as many seeds as possible in that fertile, creative imagination”</li>
<li>“Human consciousness comes into this world as a flaming ball of imagination…Our aim is…to touch his imagination and enthuse him to his inmost core” (Maria Montessori: To Educate the Human Potential)</li>
<li>The curriculum, the environment, everything includes looking at the wonders of the universe, “Let us give the child a vision of the universe” –Maria Montessori</li>
<li>Through great stories, such as the Story of the Universe and the Timeline of Life</li>
<li>Jim Boardman, political cartoonist and parent, with two children in a Montessori school, “It’s all about a kind of attention: attention given to creativity, given to handling tools, attention given to honoring another person’s space, another person’s thoughts, honoring another person, and honoring oneself…all about this kind of attention/the value of being attentive. When you teach this attitude, the work and learning are imbued with worth and that is a clear channel to which creativity can easily flow ”</li>
<li>Choice &amp; Time Enough to Work Until Satisfied/Finish; Connect with Nature; Mindful Attention; Refine Our Senses; Stories that Inspire</li>
<li>These principles can be practiced at any time, in any place</li>
<li>“Our care of the child should be governed, not by the desire to make him learn things, but by the endeavor always to keep burning within him that light which is called intelligence” (Maria Montessori)</li>

<p><strong>Sensorial Notes:</strong> Montessori Strategies for Children with Learning Differences: Chapter 4: The Montessori Method Combined with Inclusion Strategies for Children with Learning Differences and Varying Exceptionalities: by Joyce S. Pickering, with contributions from Sylvia O. Richardson</p>
<ul>
<li>“The Montessori method is an educational method for all children. ‘Typically’ developing children discover information through the use of didactic materials.  Children with learning disabilities and varying exceptionalities need careful presentations and direct teaching with these materials” (67, intro, emphasis mine).</li>
<li>In 1968, Sylvia Richardson recommended considering the Montessori method as a way to help preschoolers who were showing signs of being at risk for learning differences.  Sylvia was a pediatrician, speech-language pathologist, and Montessori-trained Early Childhood Guide (67).</li>
<li>Dr. June Shelton employed Montessori techniques to educate children with learning differences.</li>
<li>“Children with varying exceptionalities need closer direction by the (guide), avoid work they sense they cannot do, and do not develop independence as ‘typically’ developing children do.  A teacher must help instill work habits, limit work choices, or choose work for children with varying exceptionalities until they can do so for themselves” (68).</li>
<li>Typically-developing children didn’t require a 1:1 relationship with the teacher while exploring the Sensorial materials…Children with varying exceptionalities needed more individual attention (68)</li>
<li>The traditional Montessori method includes individualization, attention, structure, organization, manipulative materials, gross and fine motor development, oral language development, social skills, and an environment of encouragement. These help the child with a learning difference (68).</li>
<li>Montessori guides can use therapeutic strategies for helping children with processing and attention challenges.  These include partnering with the child to maintain focus.  Physical movement might be needed to increase attention (68).</li>
<li>Children with learning and attention differences have greater challenges with executive functioning and need to be taught a cycle of work….one must reduce a lesson’s difficulty to match the child’s developmental level…more repetition and multisensory reinforcement are necessary (68).</li>
<li>Some children with processing challenges may not understand whether they have completed a task correctly.  The teacher must offer acknowledgement and validation for their efforts and successes (68).</li>
<li>Classroom rules must be explicit and followed consistently, and children with exceptionalities may need positive feedback when following these rules (68).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Montessori Method and Enhancements for Children with Varying Exceptionalities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Procedures and presentations of the Montessori method enhance the development of attention, order and organization, gross and fine motor skills, visual and auditory perception, oral language development, the academic skills of written language and mathematics, and personality growth (69).</li>
<li>Through careful observation, guides match lessons to the child’s developmental level…helping children feel successful because they see themselves as competent (69).</li>
<li>Features of the Montessori method that support all learners, included those with exceptionalities: classroom structure, individualization, training attention, specific classroom procedures with clear limits and privileges, work organization, manipulative materials, motor skill development, oral language development, social skills development, and an environment of encouragement (69).</li>
<li>Classroom Structure: It is an orderly, prepared environment, with each area of the curriculum in a distinct area…all the materials for the lessons are meticulously arranged on trays and organized from L to R and T to B in order of difficulty on shelves.  The classroom is attractive and clutter-free.  Each lesson has a sequence and order and is presented to the children.</li>
<li>The structure of a Montessori classroom quickly guides typically-developing children towards self-control and a cycle of work within weeks (70)</li>
<li>The calm, uncluttered, organized environment is helpful for children with processing challenges (70).</li>
<li>Children with learning differences need help learning self-regulation and a work cycle.  Self-directed learners in a Montessori classroom only need the guide to present new work before they begin working independently.  This leaves the guides with more time to give individual lessons to those with learning challenges (70).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Individualization/Differentiation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Montessori method is individualized with carefully-planned lessons that are tailored to meet the needs of each child and are presented 1:1 or in small groups (70)</li>
<li>All children are respected…The guide observes the various developmental levels and follows the children’s needs in selecting lessons.  Detailed individual records allow the teacher to track each child’s progress. Children always experience some success in a lesson, creating a safe environment (70).</li>
<li>Most children are eager to join the guide for a lesson and learn something new, but children with learning differences may be reluctant if they feel unsure about a skill involved.  Guides can make their presentations shorter or reduce the number of materials used to ensure the child’s success in areas that are challenging (70).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Training Attention:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“The Montessori method provides specific procedures and techniques for developing attention.  Dr. Montessori wrote, ‘Normalization comes about through ‘concentration’ on a piece of work’ (Montessori, 1949/1995, p. 206)” (71).</li>
<li>Howard Gardner observed that the Montessori method was particularly well-suited to help children develop attention…. “…specific forms of selective attention….are among the most valuable and uniquely human of our evolutionary gifts” (Gardner, 1968, p. 78) (71).</li>
<li>Typically-developing children can filter out extraneous sights and sounds.  Attention, focus, and concentration are all functional.  The presentation of materials provides children with sequential steps necessary to complete a task.  The teacher’s slow hand-movements focus attention (71).</li>
<li>Each lesson teaches organization and sequence, enhancing executive function.  Attention, focus, and concentration are required in all steps.  Teacher’s physical presence and movements help children with attention deficits to focus. (71)</li>
<li>High-quality materials stimulate the desire to investigate, learn, and see activities through to completion (71).</li>
<li>Inhibition is encouraged by helping children learn to wait for their turn, walk slowly, talk in a quiet voice, clean up after themselves, and control their bodies and behavior (71).</li>
<li>Children with attention deficits must be taught how (and aided) to attend.  The guide must help them reach an attention level so they can learn throughout the activities, must help them make choices…they can develop work ribbons or work plans (72)</li>
<li>The Montessori classroom has techniques embedded that help aid the development of attention….such as the structure, the 3-period-lessons, and the Silence Game, which requires the inhibition of movements and practice with focusing attention.</li>
<li>Children are shown how to return the work to where it belongs.  “For children with varying exceptionalities, one enhancement that can help support their success is to mark each shelf with a symbol, which matches the symbols on the materials that belong on that shelf.  This is particularly helpful to children with attention, memory, directionality, and/or spatial problems.  Symbols help the child find where things belong.  Symbols also direct the child’s attention in the final step of each activity they complete” (72).</li>
<li>The presentations increase the skills of organizing and prioritizing (e.f. skills), also challenging for children with attention deficits</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific Classroom Procedures with Clear Limits and Privileges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Montessori classroom rules are taught explicitly through grace and courtesy lessons, so children respect other children’s work, boundaries, choose their won work, and work without interruption.  Children learn how to behave respectfully toward others and how to carefully treat the classroom materials.</li>
<li>Grace and courtesy lessons must be repeated as necessary…most children soon develop self-control and respect for the people and learning materials in the environment (73).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Work Organization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The work organization gives children a model for learning how to set up and go about completing work tasks…each lesson has consistent, sequential steps (73).</li>
<li>“The specific classroom procedures, with their clear limits and privileges, help children with inhibition control challenges.  The classroom is a prepared environment with ordered calm, which supports children with attention deficits and hyperactivity” (73).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manipulative <strong>Materials:</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Children receive multisensory perceptions from their work with manipulative materials.  Defined concepts can be learned.  The lessons progress from concrete to abstract and from simple movements/ideas to complex movements and understanding.</li>
<li>All the practical life materials allow children to explore life skills with attractive, age-appropriate (and developmentally-appropriate) materials that are their size and offer visual, tactile, and kinesthetic sensory feedback.  At the end of each presentation, when guides bring language into the lesson, the auditory sense is engaged (73).</li>
<li>The Sensorial curriculum provides precise activities to isolate the sense/quality being taught/explored and attaches vocabulary such as long/short and large/small, as well as comparatives (73).</li>
<li>Multisensory activities provide visual, auditory, kinesthetic, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory information to stimulate perceptions of size, shape, color, sound, weight, texture, smell, and taste.</li>
<li>The Sensorial materials lead directly into the Math materials, and the cultural curriculum engages the senses to teach geography, history, science, and the arts (74).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motor Skill Development:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Children move about the room and navigate the other students’ mats on the floor as they carry a variety of materials.  This requires motor coordination and balance that increase their gross motor skills, eye-hand coordination, and fine motor skills (74).</li>
<li>Fine motor skills are initially targeted in the Practical Life and Sensorial work, as the activities require eye-hand coordination and the three-finger grasp (pincer) used for writing (74).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Oral Language Development:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The presentations, given in small sequential steps with scientifically researched materials, enhance language development, as well as skills in: math, geography, history, art, music, and the sciences.</li>
<li>Learning for all children is enhanced by the meticulous presentations and helps with vocabulary development (74).</li>
<li>For children with challenges relating to oral language, one should repeat the vocabulary of all attributes and functions of materials in each presentation.  The amount of vocabulary introduced needs to be tailored to the child’s language development (74).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Skills Development:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Guides model considerate, courteous behavior and teach direct lessons in grace and courtesy.  The guides are role models for emotional intelligence and children can practice and absorb this.</li>
<li>Skills such as helping others when they spill, respecting a child’s work/space, and saying, “please,” and “thank you” are modeled and practiced (75).</li>
<li>Children with exceptionalities might have varying social skills and need more direct teaching.</li>
<li>The Choices program, developed by Dr. Laura Ames, includes direct instruction and training to help children develop social skills/social competence (75).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Environment of Encouragement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Montessori classroom is encouraging and doesn’t emphasize “failure,” thus encouraging the child’s venturing toward independence.  A mantra is, “ ‘mistakes are not bad; they are the way we learn’”  (75).</li>
<li>If we try and don’t succeed, try again in another way.</li>
<li>There are no grades, only progress reports; no tests, just meticulous observations, so the guide knows what the child needs next (75).</li>
<li>This is a healthy environment for all, and crucial for those with exceptionalities</li>
<li>Children with exceptionalities require additional support from the guide than those who are typically-developing.  They need validation/confirmation regarding the correctness/preciseness of their completed works.  Avoid praise, merely state the fact.</li>
<li>Montessori believed typically-developing children did not need praise and needed to achieve inner satisfaction (be intrinsically motivated).  Children with exceptionalities might not always perceive when their work is accurate or inaccurate, making it more difficult for the development of intrinsic motivation and/or engagement in their work.  Validation from the guide is helpful (76).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contrast of Typical Development and the Development of Children with Varying Exceptionalities; Montessori Strategies that Enhance Learning for Children with Varying Exceptionalities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Children with exceptionalities may have distorted/overwhelming perceptions of the world and these may cause discomfort.  The order and calm within a Montessori environment is supportive for children with varying exceptionalities (77).</li>
<li>Children with exceptionalities may have uncoordinated body movements.  The carrying and work with the multisensory materials of various sizes and weights aids in their development of more coordinated movements.  “On the line” procedures, moving to rhythms, marching, hopping, and skipping to music all aid both the typically and atypically developing children in their gross motor development.</li>
<li>Children with challenges regarding maintaining patterns, cutting that is jagged/jerky, holding pencil awkwardly benefit from the manipulation of the materials in the classroom.  There is much preparation of the hand for writing, use of thumb, index, and middle fingers working together for grasping and releasing.  The Metal Insets provide pre-writing skills (77).</li>
<li>Children with exceptionalities may have minimal vocabulary and may have trouble with comprehension.  All the lessons presented silently allow children to process the perceptual information demonstrated and then the language is added.  Curriculum for children at-risk needs to be extended from vocabulary development to effective oral communication.  The three-period lesson can be utilized.</li>
<li>Although typically-developing children may begin to read by five, children with atypical development may struggle with learning letters and their sounds and have variable performance regarding writing.  The sandpaper letters allow visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and tactile information which increases the sound/symbol correspondence.  The Movable Alphabet provides the child with 3-D letters that the child can manipulate to practice word building by using sound/symbol knowledge…giving children a beginning reading activity.</li>
<li>All activities in the Montessori classroom reinforce the L to R, Top to Bottom pattern of reading.</li>
<li>Reading, writing, and spelling proceed at each child’s rate (78).</li>
<li>Atypically-developing children may have challenges with attention.  Behavior may be hyperactive, hypoactive, or distractible.  Inhibition control doesn’t develop typically, therefore focus and concentration are faulty (78).</li>
<li>The Montessori environment has a prepared environment with organization of materials….the areas are prepared for children’s usage.  The atmosphere is calm, the order of presentations assist in focus, the child waits for their turn and to complete the full cycle of activity.  The silence game teaches inner calm, concentration, and focus.  The classroom structure has clear limits/freedoms; the guide helps children develop inhibition techniques and central focus (78).</li>
<li>Atypically developing children usually match within normal limits.  Challenge with discrimination of sensory information can occur and there can be discrimination/memory difficulties in math or letter symbols.  There can be difficulties with association of symbol to name  (13).</li>
<li>The sensorial curriculum allows the guide to assess the child’s ability to perceive, discriminate, and graduate visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory information.  The sensorial discriminations and the associated language concepts are significant in the progression to higher cognitive functions such as categorizing, generalizing, and the beginning of reasoning.  All areas use VAKT to assess the child in perceptual discrimination and memory required in language and math (79).</li>
<li>Atypically-developing children may have challenges ordering work tasks and working sequentially.   In Montessori classrooms, all activities have specific sequence.  The guide helps the child refine work habits which helps the child gain the skills of analysis necessary for organization (80).</li>
<li>Children with atypical development may not establish a true work cycle without teacher support/additional guidance.  The teacher can enhance the work cycle by teaching the child how to make choices, set up the work, choose areas for work, complete a full cycle of activity, and return the work to its proper place (80).</li>
<li>Children with atypical development may gravitate only to work they have mastered and avoid work that is more difficult for them.  They might avoid working with letters, numbers, writing, and need teacher guidance for choices.  The Montessori procedures allow the teacher to guide the child in learning to choose their work.  A guide may allow choice, limit choices, or make choices for the child until the child can work independently.</li>
<li>Children with atypical development may avoid work and be insecure due to lack of successful learning experiences in the classroom.  May choose to replace the work with easier work or wander the classroom.  In the Montessori classroom, the structure of the classroom and procedure for working with the activities foster organized work habits (80).</li>
<li>Atypically-developing children may have variable performance related to number, quantity concepts, longer work time for master, may struggle associating symbol/numeral association.  They may have challenges with patterns, skip counting, and 1:1 correspondence.  In Montessori classrooms, materials are manipulative and multisensory.  There are many works that reinforce number to quantity activities, like the Number Rods (1-10),  Spindle Box (concept of 0), Tile Game (1-10/odd, even).  Teen Boards and Ten Boards allow for language of teen numbers (80).</li>
<li>The decimal system is introduced early, as well as the base ten system; children can build various quantities from 1-9,000 with the golden beads and numerals (81).</li>
<li>The golden beads introduce addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division.  Numeral-writing is introduced with sandpaper numerals.  Skip counting introduced with bead chains.  Addition and subtraction boards, multiplication and division boards help give concrete math work (81).</li>
<li>Children with atypical development have lack the neurological maturation that enables inhibition control.  They may lack self-control and need direct instruction in inhibition, how to accept responsibility, how to persevere, and how to act considerately/courteously.  A guide must explicitly teach appropriate behavior and social skills, guide children towards inhibition of impulsive behavior, as well as in self-control, accepting responsibility, perseverance, and consideration of others (81).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Montessori Practical Life and Additional Supports for Early Childhood:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Practical Life activities help young children enhance attention and develop motor skills.  Children practice hand-eye coordination while focusing on a task, focus on their work, and lengthen attention span through their focus.  Children with exceptionalities require many hours of practice needed (82).</li>
<li>Children may need activities limited/adapted to their level….like pouring only three small beans from one pitcher to another, or placing a red circle in the bottom to give them a place to aim.  The pouring activities can slowly increase in difficulty as children progress.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Montessori Practical Life and Additional Supports for Elementary and Adolescents:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Through science experiments, projects, and cooking, children continue practicing Practical Life skills in elementary and middle school.  More demanding academic activities can then be interspersed with less demanding tasks.</li>
<li>Activities:  food preparation, cleaning and maintaining the classroom (including washing and polishing items and furniture), polishing (silver, copper, brass, pewter), packing a suitcase, organizing a locker, notebook, folder, making models, sanding a table, changing a tire, manicuring, gardening, presenting Practical Life activities to younger children</li>
<li>Some activities presented that had been presented at younger ages are presented later with a higher level of difficulty</li>
<li>Attention to detail and careful completion of the work is still necessary</li>
<li>The teacher needs to believe in the essence of the work ethic and pride in all tasks done well, the older children’s attitude will mirror the teacher’s and they will often perform tasks such as pouring activities (83).</li>
<li>Continuing Practical Life activities provide an opportunity to master hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, order and sequence, and improve sustained attention.  All of these are critical for success in academic work (83).</li>
<li>In every Montessori classroom, regardless of age, children should be engaged in Practical Life work (83).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Montessori Sensorial Curriculum and Additional Supports:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Children learn to classify and categorize their world through their senses (84).</li>
<li>Sensorial materials are auto-educational and can make education possible for children with a wide spectrum of learning abilities.  Many preschool classrooms assume children will automatically perceive differences, discriminate, and classify…whereas the Montessori curriculum offers a program directly teaching these, assessing students’ abilities, and addressing areas of importance (84).</li>
<li>Children with varying exceptionalities may have dysfunctional perceptual discrimination and may be unable to categorize and classify.  The Montessori Sensorial curriculum can help children with varying exceptionalities improve their perceptual discrimination, so they are better prepared to move toward reasoning skills (84).</li>
<li>With the direct instruction provided in a Montessori classroom, children can manipulate materials and feel the contrasts and sensations of the unique, specially-designed Sensorial materials and expand their vocabulary.  Children can become more sensitive to the impressions of the environment and learn to distinguish, categorize, and relate new information (84).</li>
<li>Sensorial materials are beneficial at all levels.  Children during the elementary years who have had the advantage of the early childhood Montessori can benefit from Montessori’s early childhood methods adapted with addition supports (84).</li>
<li>Children with varying exceptionalities process sensorial information differently and have challenges attaching language to their perceptions.  The Montessori Sensorial curriculum offers teachers a way to observe the developmental of perceptual skills and the development of language defining those perceptions (84).</li>
<li>Montessori guides have a rigorous understanding of child development and the materials and methods to help at-risk children to progress from delayed development to age-appropriate development.</li>
<li>Additional support techniques Montessorians need to be aware of: break presentations into even smaller steps (such as using three pink cubes), illustrate the concept of size gradation (85).</li>
<li>Encourage children to feel the material and look at it.  Utilizing more than one sense can be helpful for children with exceptionalities (85).</li>
<li>One can reduce the number of color tablets to be graded, selecting the darkest, the middle shade, and the lightest shade (85).</li>
<li>Make control charts for children with spatial perception challenges.</li>
<li>Observe and analyze: why is the child having challenges, what can I do to structure this activity for success, structure every presentation for success, so the student(s) will continue trying, attach further language to every presentation after the child has mastered the perceptual task.</li>
<li>Continue sensorial work in the upper elementary classroom grades and beyond.  Children with exceptionalities benefit from a longer timeframe of exposure to these activities (86).</li>
<li>Older children can give lessons to younger children with exceptionalities (86).</li>
<li>Adapt Sensorial activities for older children.</li>
<li>Let children first work with 3D materials, then work with the 2D materials for that lesson, and then have them work with just paper and pencil (87).</li>
<li>“Whether through Practical Life or Sensorial work, when children interact with self-corrective materials they learn mistakes are not bad, but are the way we learn.  The guide reinforces this, and engages the child in discussion: ‘How do you think you can do it?’ ‘Try it.’ ‘It’s okay if it’s wrong, then you can try it another way.’” (88).</li>
<li>Try to help minimize children’s negative reaction to something they try and can’t do yet.  With direct instruction (and understanding), frustration, anger, giving up, rushing through, cheating, or avoiding challenges can be avoided (88).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Montessori Mathematics and Additional Supports:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Sensorial materials are a prerequisite to mathematics as the child learns to discriminate greater than and less than through varying size dimensions in the Sensorial curriculum before moving to the more abstract concept of relative quantity that numbers represent (88).</li>
<li>Children with exceptionalities can often have challenges with abstract reasoning and need longer 1:1 lessons in mathematics.  The use of 3D models demonstrates models and functions (88).</li>
<li>The two most critical components of learning math are visual-spatial ability and the language of math (Krasa and Shunkwiler, 2009).  Children with challenges in math may have very different visual-spatial perception and develop a stronger understanding of mathematics by working with the 3D models as well (88).</li>
<li>The MACAR manual gives detailed math presentations for the child with learning differences (88).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Guides can follow traditional Montessori practices and add additional strategies tailored to children’s individual needs  (89).</li>
<li>“Children who struggle with motor coordination, oral language development, reading and spelling, and the maintenance of attention often develop anxiety about school.  One of the most significant advantages of the Montessori method is that when children with special needs interact with self-corrective materials, they learn that mistakes are not bad, but are the way we learn” (89).</li>
<li>Success is the major motivation for learning.  The Montessori method allows for the task to be matched to the child’s ability level.</li>
<li>Presentations can be structured for success, which helps eliminate hostility, bullying, bossiness, or withdrawal (89).</li>
<li>“Experiencing success can be the difference between a child growing into a person with inadequate school performance and damaged self-esteem, or a person who is productive, coping well, and contributing to society” (89).</li>

<p>Idea from Ellen: First _____ (pictures of work he has to choose first), then _____ (pictures of items he can do after completing the first row);
For Kindergarteners, by March, maybe say they first have to work on reading, writing, and math, and then afterwards can choose their work</p>
<p>Help children who will be transitioning to 1st grade begin to write work plans; can have children take pictures to document work, put it on SeeSaw/maybe Shutterfly could do this?</p>

<h1 id="lecture-10-unlocking-the-intelligence">Lecture 10: Unlocking the Intelligence:</h1>
<ul>
<li>“To human beings, identities are more strikingly visible than dissimilarities.  For instance, one’s attention is easily drawn to twins.  Contrasts, too, attract attention.  This is why when we present the materials, we start with the extremes.  Once the attention is focused and the interest aroused by experience, we can help the child through the gradations to arrive at a refinement of observation and intelligence.  This gradation allows the individual to appreciate small differences” (80).</li>
<li>“If the gradation is measured, if the distances between each differing objects are alike, the observation becomes methodical, scientific, clear and constructive for the mind and the clarity of perception is greater” (80).</li>
<li>“Another important factor is the isolation of the sense….If one sense is isolated, it seems to be enhanced in its power of perception. The possibility of perception is more profound” (80).</li>
<li>“The conscious mind continually receives impressions through all the doors of the senses” (80).</li>
<li>“We take note of all these facts in order to help the children receive clear impressions.  If one sense fails, the others seem to be sharpened…Nature has bestowed great potential on us.  This potential is not fully developed; it is developed to an extent just enough for us to live and understand the world around us” (80).</li>
<li>“If one sense is lacking, the interest of the individual is concentrated on the remaining senses, and by using them, the individual can almost reach the same degree of perception: sometimes this can even be surpassed” (80).</li>
<li>“…(T)he isolation of the senses is a great help towards the clarity of reception of the impressions.  If we wish to be of help to children, we must help them achieve something which they cannot achieve by themselves, such as the theory of color, or the three dimensions of the relativity of heat.  You can not explain all these facts in words.  However, you can pave the way for experiences through which the subconscious mind will become imbued with these facts.  They will come to recognize them unconsciously, and they will therefore appreciate the differences, etc., though comparison and their own experiences.  They will be able to learn for themselves something which we could not transmit by using words alone.  We give an abstraction.  They learn to understand this abstract concept by using the material.  We call this mechanism materialized abstraction” (81).</li>
<li>Practical help we can give: “It is through the eyes that we receive impressions of color, size, and shape” (81).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cylinders">Cylinders:</h2>
<ul>
<li>“Cylinders give an impression of shape”…The various sets of cylinder differ in: one dimension, two dimensions, three dimensions (81).</li>
<li>“It would be very difficult to make a child understand if I spoke to him about it as I have to you.  A child would not be interested in an explanation.  But at 2.5 years, children are eager to acquire motor experiences along certain lines; they ar also eager when they are 1.5 and 2 years” (82).</li>
<li>Introduce gradations: children enjoy learning to recognize identities (and gradations)…recognizing the two extremes is easiest and one should start with the presentation there</li>
<li>The unit of gradation is .5cm…an organized, methodical, measured gradation (81-82).</li>
<li>One starts with presenting the set with gradations in two dimensions, since all the cylinders have the same height, the little knob is always easy to hold, even if a cylinder is misplaced.</li>
<li>The attention is held through the eye, which notices the difference (82)…the child’s mind is forced to remain attentive.</li>
<li>The control of error captivates the child’s mind…the child’s intelligence and his eyes perceive</li>
<li>Teachers don’t give an explanation</li>
<li>The teacher removes all cylinders from the block where the differences are in two dimensions and places them on a cleared table…taking them out one by one with the pincer grasp.</li>
<li>Children may repeat this exercise twenty times, maybe 200</li>
<li>“The differences are absorbed in his subconscious” (83).</li>
<li>“Once he has acquired the power of observation and discrimination, you can give him the other sets” (83)….do not present the sets on the same day.  Then give: 2 sets together, three sets together, all sets together.</li>
<li>**Direct Aim:<strong>visual discrimination of size; in</strong>Direct Aim:**preparation for writing/holding the pencil.  Control of error is in the material (the cylinders can only be placed flush in their correct places).  <strong>Age:</strong> 2.5-3</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pink-tower-broad-stair-long-rods">Pink Tower, Broad Stair, Long Rods:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aim: to aid visual discrimination of size or dimensions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Long Rods differ in 1 dimension</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Broad Stair differs in 2 dimensions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pink tower: differs in three dimensions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn’t matter which apparatus you present first, as long as children have acquired a sense of precision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The children must not take the apparatus directly from one another; the children must always return it to its proper location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the children become normalized, they will be obedient/accept what the guide says…”If they do not accept what you say, if they rebel, it is because they are at war with adult humanity.  Therefore we say do not give this exercise, which must be carried out with great precision, before they have become normalized by the exercises of practical life.  Normalization must come first; the exercises of practical life bring the mind back to normality” (84).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be careful how you handle the apparatus, as the children will imitate you (84).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start with only 3-4 of the long rods, then gradually increase these as they have been mastered. Place the rods next to each other longest to shortest with one end level to each of the rods.  Run your finger along each of the rods as you place them next to each other one end to the other.  This is to achieve a muscular impression of the length of the rods (85).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="broad-stair">Broad Stair</h2>
<ul>
<li>Must be placed with great precision for clarity….pick up the largest with one hand, then the next, placing them alongside each other.  Emphasize that the prisms must be put on the same level.  “Your interest, seriousness, and attention will make the child realize that it is important” (85).</li>
<li>The difference is in 2 dimensions, so hold the prisms across their thickness, allowing the whole hand to receive the impression of their thickness (85)</li>
<li>**Direct Aim:<strong>Visual discrimination of dimensions; In</strong>Direct Aim:**Muscular education of grip, preparation of the mechanical mind</li>
<li><strong>Control of Error:</strong> the arrangement of the prisms lacks harmony; if a mistake is made, let children try again…experience helps them acquire subtleties of perception.  Do not point out the error…(86).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pink-tower">Pink Tower:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The tiny cube can disappear if you’re not careful</li>
<li>Take the large cube in one hand</li>
<li>Differences are in three dimensions</li>
<li>Emphasize the degree of exactness in placing the cubes, placing the next cube exactly in the center</li>
<li>**Direct Aim:<strong>visual discrimination; in</strong>Direct Aim:**education of voluntary muscles, preparation of the hands, preparation of the mathematical mind</li>
<li><strong>Age:</strong> 2.5-3 years</li>
<li><strong>Control of Error:</strong> The eye of the child, which will see harmony (or note disharmony)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="indirect-preparation">Indirect Preparation:</h2>
<ul>
<li>“In every action there is a motive of interest.  Through it, the organs are prepared for something in the future.  It is the conscious interest of the moment that prepares the intelligence and the organ for future development, though the individual is unaware of this” (86-87).</li>
<li>Immediate interest enables children to acquire skills/coordination required…holding the knob of the cylinders with the first two fingers and thumb is a preparation of the coordination of hand for writing.  At a later age the intelligence of the child will urge him to write…he will be impeded if not prepared (87).</li>
<li>The mathematical mind is especially interested in mathematics, finding them interesting and absorbing.  Most children in Montessori schools are enthusiastic about mathematics, due to the preparation of their minds (87).</li>
<li>“The subconscious enters into this: for you cannot become interested in anything which is absolutely new to you.  You only become interested in something if you already know it subconsciously.  If you have had a previous experience and are then given a guide, you make a conscious realization of that which was in the subconscious” (87-88).</li>
<li>“To acquire a mathematical mind there must have been exact experiences first.  Observations of exact mathematical relationships must be stored in the subconscious, so that when the conscious mind is brought into these things, an interest is aroused” (88).</li>
<li>The long rods range between one meter and one decimeter…in a linear progression (88).</li>
<li>The progression of the brown stair is: four of the first prism make up the second (2*2);</li>
<li>In the pink tower, eight of the first cube make the second cube (2<em>2</em>2)</li>
<li>“You do not have to tell this to a child, but he experiences it with sight, movement, and muscular sense” (88).</li>
<li>Later, these experiences help children apply the concepts of 1 gram of water = 1 cup of water, 1 liter of water=1 cu dm of water, 1 liter of water=1000 grams</li>
<li>“The secret of the intelligence is that you cannot transfer information directly to the conscious.  You must first transfer information to the subconscious. Once the subconscious has acquired experience, the intelligence will accept it” (88).</li>
<li>“The conscious can be imposed upon, but the subconscious refuses to be imposed upon, and the conscious only retains what is imbedded in the subconscious” (88).</li>
<li>“There is a vital force in every human being which leads them to make ever greater efforts for the realization of individual potentialities.  Our tendency is to realize them.  Joy and interest will come when we can realize the potentialities…within us” (88-89).</li>
<li>“The potentialities can be attached to material and spiritual welfare.  In the same way children work with maximum effort at something difficult….If the child does not have the possibility of realizing these potentialities, it is an obstacle to life and you will produce a timid, subdued animal, instead of this huge force” (88-89).</li>

<ol start="12">
<li>Let the child(ren) continue to explore the differences in the texture on their feet</li>
<li>Invite the child(ren) to be led to the various surfaces with their eyes closed or with a blindfold on…if done with multiple children, this can be done with pairs, otherwise the guides/adults  act as the child’s guide</li>
<li>Identify the surface one’s foot is on: grass, stone, brick, pavement, etc.…..(gradually add more options as this lesson is mastered and according to availability in the area).</li>
<li>(If this was completed as a continuation of the lesson): discuss the differences in the sense of touch between touching with the hands and touching with the feet</li>
<li>Wash feet in bins of slightly soapy water</li>
<li>Dry Feet</li>
<li>Return shoes to one’s feet</li>
<li>Thank the child(ren)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><strong>Points of Interest:</strong></strong> Being outside (to explore the sense of touch), being able to differentiate touch sensations blindfolded, being able to remove one’s shoes to explore the sense of touch through one’s feet</p>
<p>Extensions Gradually add other items to sensorially explore through the sense of touch outside-practice feeling with one’s hands versus with one’s feet</p>
<p><strong><strong>Control of Error:</strong></strong> The feeling of the various textures; being able to open one’s eyes and visually see whether one had guessed the item in nature they were feeling with their hands or feet</p>
<p><strong>Extensions/<strong>Variations:</strong></strong> Continue to add more from nature that the child(ren) can explore using the tactile sense; allow for explorations with hands as well as with feet and compare/contrast; let children use blindfolds and attempt to label what they are touching with their hands/feet as the guide or another student leads them along the playground….Gradually add lessons such as this for the other senses as well, exploring them outside</p>
<p><strong><strong>Vocabulary:</strong></strong> rough, smooth, soft, flat, hard, warm, cold, fuzzy, heavy, light</p>
<p><strong>Materials that I have made are below:</strong> (one is a journal for children to complete as they are exploring their senses in nature, another is a basket of items from nature that can be explored inside: it contains fresh and old walnuts (the green ones have a very strong scent (for olfactory), fresh green leaves (which are smooth), a tiny branch (which is rough), a stone (smooth), and a pine sprig (which is sharp/pointy)…there are leaves of various sizes which can be seriated for visual discrimination as well).  Ideally, this is a basket I will change throughout the weeks/months of the year and will gradually expand to include: seashells, sand dollars, a cleaned/disinfected feather, snail shells, pinecones, fresh flowers, etc.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-12-education-of-the-senses">Chapter 12: Education of the Senses:</h2>
<ul>
<li>“The education of the senses must undoubtedly assume the greatest importance” (128).</li>
<li>“Pedagogy…is not designed to measure the sensations, but educate the senses” (128).</li>
<li>“(T)he education of the senses is entirely possible” (128).</li>
<li>“We start essentially from a method, …and not vice versa….The method used by me is that of making a pedagogical experiment with a didactic object and awaiting the spontaneous reaction of the child. This is a method in every way analogous to that of experimental psychology” (128).</li>
<li>“The esthesiometer carries within itself the possibility of measuring; my objects on the contrary, often do not permit a measure, but are adapted to cause the child to exercise the senses” (128, emphasis mine).</li>
<li>“It is necessary that (the instrument of learning/material) shall not weary but shall divert the child…the psychometric instruments are great consumers of energy-(when Pizzoli used them, children were annoyed/tired by them)…the aim of education is to better develop the energies” (128).</li>
<li>“With little children, we must proceed to the making of trials, and must select the didactic materials in which they show themselves to be interested” (128).</li>
<li>Many of the materials used in the education of those with exceptionalities were abandoned, many were modified (128).</li>
<li>Maria Montessori decided on a selection of objects, the didactic system (129).</li>
<li>“…(T)he same didactic material used with (children with exceptionalities)  makes education possible, while with (other) children it provokes auto-education ….(which) inspired and rendered possible the method of observation and liberty” (129).</li>
<li>“First object=a block in which solid geometric forms are set.  Into corresponding holes in the blocks are set ten little wooden cylinders, the bases diminishing gradually about ten mm. The game consists in taking the cylinders out of their places, putting them on the table, mixing them, and then putting each one in its own place.   The aim is to educate the eye to the differential perception of dimensions” (129).</li>
<li>“…(O)ut of all the didactic material this is the game preferred by the very little children of two and a half and three years” (129).</li>
<li>“(The typically developing) child takes spontaneously a lively interest in this game.  He pushes away all that would interfere, or offer to help him, and wishes to be alone before his problem” (130).</li>
<li>“(The typically-developing) child attentively observes the relation between the size of the opening and that of the object which he is to place in the mold, and is greatly interested in the game, as is clearly shown by the expression of attention on the little face.  If he mistakes, placing one of the objects in an opening that is too small for it, he takes it away, and proceeds to make various trials, seeking the proper opening.  IF he makes a contrary error, letting the cylinder fall into an opening that is too large for it, and then collects all the successive cylinders in openings just a little too large, he will find himself at the last with the big cylinder in his hand while only the smallest opening is empty.  The didactic material controls every error” (130).</li>
<li>The child can correct himself in a variety of ways; feeling or shaking the cylinders (130).</li>
<li>“…(I)t is precisely in these errors that the educational importance of the didactic material lies; and when the child with evident security places each piece in its proper place, he has outgrown the exercise, and this piece of material becomes useless to him” (130).</li>
<li>“This self-correction leads the child to concentrate his attention upon the differences of dimensions, and to compare the various pieces.  It is in just this comparison that the psycho-sensory exercise lies” (130).</li>
<li>“There is, therefore, no question here of teaching the child the knowledge of the dimensions, through the medium of these pieces.  Neither is it our aim that the child shall know how to use, without an error, the material presented to him thus performing the exercises well” (130).</li>
<li>“Here instead it is the work of the child, the auto-correction, the auto-education which acts, for the teacher must not interfere in the slightest way. No teacher can furnish the child with the agility which he acquires through gymnastic exercises: it is necessary that the pupil perfects himself through his own efforts.  It is very much the same with the education of the senses” (130).</li>
<li>“…(A) man is not what he is because of the teachers he has had, but because of what he has done” (130).</li>
<li>With non-Montessori teachers, a challenge can be in preventing their interventions when children are puzzled/continuing to make repeated efforts….allow the child the joy of overcoming an obstacle (130-131).</li>
<li>“(Typically-developing) children repeat such exercises many ties…(which varies according to the individual). Others will remove and replace the pieces at least twenty times, with an expression of evident interest.  Once, after I had watched a little one of four years repeat this exercise sixteen times, I had the other children sing in order to distract her, but she continued unmoved to take out the cylinders, mix them up, and put them back in their places” (131).</li>
<li>“(W)hen the child educates himself, and when the control and correction of errors is yielded to the didactic material, there remains nothing for the teacher but to observe.  She must be more of a psychologist than a teacher, and this shows the importance of a scientific preparation on the part of the teacher” (131).</li>
<li>…”(T)he teacher teaches little and observes much….direct(ing) the psychic activity of the children” (whence the title directress instead of teacher) (131).</li>
<li>The teacher “directs the life and the soul” (131).</li>
<li>“The education of the senses has, as its aim, the refinement of the differential perception of stimuli by means of repeated exercise.  There exists a sensory culture” (131).</li>
<li>One can use the cubes of different sizes and place them at varying distances, of which the child will select the smallest and largest (132).</li>
<li>Pink tower/series of 10 cubes: the first has a base of ten cm, and the others decrease 1 cm at the base, the smallest having a base of 1 cm.   One must build these up in the pink tower…selecting the largest each time (132).</li>
<li>“Our didactic materials render auto-education possible, permits a methodical education of the senses.  Not upon the ability of the teacher does such auto-education rest, but upon the didactic system. This presents objects which, first, attract the spontaneous education of the child, and, second, contain a rational gradation of stimuli” (132).</li>
<li>“We must not confuse the education of the senses, with the concrete ideas which may be gathered from our environment by means of the senses” (132).</li>
<li>“The directress of the ‘Children’s House’ must have a clear idea of the two factors which enter into her work-the guidance of the child, and the individual exercise. Only after she has this concept clearly fixed in her mind, may she proceed to the application of a method to guide the spontaneous education of the child and to impart necessary notions to him” (133).</li>
<li>“In the opportune quality and in the manner of this intervention lies the personal art of the educator” (133).</li>
<li>For the exercise of the chromatic sense, after grading the silk colors, Montessori added the exercise of showing one particular colored tablet, then spread it out among the rest of the colors and had the child remember and select it (133).</li>
<li>“However desirable it may be to furnish a sense of education as a basis for intellectual ideas, it is …advisable at the same time to associate the language with these perceptions” (135).</li>
<li>The three period lesson: 1st period: the association of the sensory perception with the name.  2nd period: recognition of the object corresponding to the name. ex. “Give me the red, Give me the blue.”   Third period: The remembering of the name corresponding to the object.  “What is this?”  (135)</li>
<li>Seguin urged that the colors be left for the children to observe for several minutes, advised not to present only one at a time, but two together (135).</li>
<li>“For (typically-developing) children there exists a period proceeding the Three Periods of Seguin-a period which contains the real sense education. This is the acquisition of the fineness of differential perception, which can be obtained only through auto-education” (135).</li>
<li>“The association of the name with the stimulus is a source of great pleasure to the normal child” (135).</li>
<li>“Another important particular…lies in isolating the sense, whenever…possible”-Hearing exercises are more successful in an environment of silence and even darkness, or with a blindfold. Example, having child blindfolded while listening for only a whisper or blindfolded during the baric exercise (136).</li>
<li>“We speak…of games in education, but it must be made clear that we understand by this term a free activity, ordered to a definite end; not disorderly noise, which distracts the attention” (136).</li>
<li>Example of a child blindfolded raising a finger when he heard Montessori’s voice</li>
<li>In regards to music: “It was no longer a case of simply noting the sounds of the voice, but of perceiving the difference and of appreciating all these modifications and varieties of tone which go to make up the music of the word” (137).</li>
<li>In regards to the distribution of the stimuli: one should proceed from few stimuli that strongly contrast to may stimuli in gradual differentiation always more fine and imperceptible (138).  For example, presenting the shortest and longest of the red rods, the thinnest and thickest of the broad stair, then the delicately different in tints or thickness or length (138).</li>

<ul>
<li>“The education of the tactile and thermic senses go together…the warm bath, and heat, render the tactile sense more acute.  …(for the tactile sense), bathing the hands in warm water has the additional advantage of teaching the child a principle of cleanliness-that of not touching objects with hands that are not clean”…have children wash hands, care for their nails, etc., as preparation for the tactile stimuli (140).</li>
<li>Limit the tactile exercise to the cushioned tips of the fingers…prepares the person to use the medium of the finger tips (140).</li>
<li>Teach the child how to touch by taking the finger of the child and drawing it very, very gently over the surface (140).</li>
<li>Teach the child to close his eyes while touching, drawing his attention to how he can notice the tactile differences  more acutely with his eyes closed.  Children seem to enjoy this and exercising the tactile sense in this manner (140).</li>
<li>Didactic <strong>Materials:</strong>  a rectangular wooden board divided into two equal rectangles, one covered with very smooth paper (or very smooth wood), the other covered with sandpaper.  B)a tablet covered with alternate strips of smooth and rough</li>
<li>Thermic Sense: a set of little metal bowls, filled with water of different temperatures, measured with a thermometer</li>
<li>For chromatic sense, there are eight colors, with eight shades, making 64 total gradations (141)</li>
<li>For education of baric sense (weight), use little wooden tablets in three different types of wood….weighing 24, 18, and 12 grams, …”(T)he child, observing the color, knows that they are of differing weights, and this offers a means of controlling the exercise.  He takes two of the tablets in his hands, letting them rest upon the palm at the base of his outstretched fingers.  The he moves his hands up and down in order to gauge the weight.  We lead the child to make his distinction purely through the difference in weight, leaving out the guide of the different colors, and closing his eyes.  He learns to do this of himself, and takes great interest in “guessing.”  (141).</li>
<li>This game attracts the attention of others, who want to use the blindfold…</li>
<li>“The education of this sense leads to the recognition of objects through feeling…through the simultaneous help of the tactile and muscular senses” (141).</li>
<li>“The first didactic material used by us is made up of the bricks and cubes of Froebel.  We call attention of the child to the form of the two solids, have him feel them carefully and accurately, with his eyes open, repeating some phrase serving to fix his attention upon the participants of the forms presented” (141-142).</li>
<li>“The child is told to place the cubes to the right, the bricks to the left, always feeling them, and without looking at them….the exercise is repeated, by the child blindfolded”…after 2-3 times, children can eliminate the error…the child’s pleasure is greatly increased by the being watched by his classmates (142).</li>
<li>“The child had to recognize the form, and to remember throughout the exercise the proper placing of the different objects.  This seemed to me very difficult for a child of three years.  But observing her I saw that she not only performed the exercise easily, but that the movements with which we had taught her to feel the form were superfluous.  Indeed the instant she had taken the two objects in her hands, if it so happened that she had taken a cube with the left hand and a brick in the right, she exchanged them immediately, and then began the laborious feeling the form which we had taught and which she perhaps, believed to be obligatory.  But the objects had been recognized by her through the first light touch, that is, the recognition was contemporaneous to the taking” (142).</li>
<li>The little girl above was functionally ambidextrous</li>
<li>Children were able to recognize the objects before feeling their contours during the next lesson, especially the little ones</li>
<li>The stereognostic exercises delight in recognizing the stimulus…The children come to discriminate between small forms varying very slightly, such as corn, wheat, and rice (143).</li>
<li>The children can “see without eyes.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Education of the Senses of Taste and Smell:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Children’s olfactory sense is not developed  to any great extent, this makes it difficult to attract their attention through this sense</li>
<li>Have children smell various fresh flowers…hold the flowers under the children’s nose, letting him guess the name of the flower (143).</li>
<li>Children can practice this sense during the lunch hour</li>
<li>For taste, one can touch the tongue with various solutions (on a Q-tip) of bitter, acidic, sweet, salty…then show the child how to rinse their mouths….</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Education of the Sense of Vision:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Solid Insets: Three solid blocks of wood, each containing ten wooden pieces, set into corresponding holes.  They are cylinders, handled by a brass or wooden knob at the center of the top.  The first set has cylinders that are equal in height, but differ in diameter.  The 2nd set, the cylinders are equal in diameter, but differ in height.  In the 3rd set, the cylinders differ in height and diameter.  With these, the child learns to differentiate according to thickness, height, and size” (144).</li>
<li>Second:
<ul>
<li>a: Large pieces in graded dimensions-three sets of blocks, one should have two in each school, they vary in from thick to thin.  They are ten quadrilateral prisms, the largest of which has a base of ten cm, the others decreasing by 1 cm…all of equal length (the brown stair).  The child mixes them and then places them in order according to their thickness, making sure to place them so their length corresponds exactly.  The child can begin with the thinnest or the thickest piece.  The child’s eyes can recognize any error, and the stair would be irregular, if so.</li>
<li>b:. length: These are the ten red rods, the first being one meter long, and the last a decimeter.  The rods decrease by 1 decimeter each.  Each space of one decimeter is placed alternately red or blue….all together, it appears as a rectangular triangle which decreases on the side of the hypotenuse (145).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The child places the rods randomly on the rug and then puts them together according to the graduation of length.  If the rods alternate in red and blue, then he can observe the pattern of colors.  The control of error is in the hypothenuse.</li>
<li>With the red and blue rods, one can count from 1 to 10 and it leads into the study of the decimal and metric system (145).</li>
<li>Size This is the pink tower (rose-colored).  The largest has a base of 10 cm, the smallest of 1 cm, each one decreasing by 1 cm each.  The work is to build the pink cubes up in a tower, the largest cube forming the base and the smallest forming the apex.  The control is in the regularity or irregularity of the tower…any misplaced cube breaks the line.</li>
<li>The most common error with the pink cube is placing the second largest cube as the base and placing the larger cube on top of that one.</li>
<li>These three sets may be used by children in a different way.  The pieces may be mixed at the rug or table and put in order at a distance, to which the child must walk with focus to retain the memory of the size/dimension he is looking for.  These games are excellent for 4-5-year-old children (146).</li>
<li>The construction of the pink tower draws the attention of the 3-year-olds, who take it down and build it up again and again (146).</li>
<li>The insets require placing shapes in their corresponding openings, grasping them by the knobs with the three-pincer grasp.</li>
<li>The insets used for teaching shape/form are all blue.</li>
<li>Wooden 3-D models of geometric figures are placed above their 2-D form/frame….the goal is to lead toward exactness in regard to control of dimension and form, brought about by the frame which gives the exercise the control (147).</li>
<li>The geometric cabinet consists of 6 trays…each drawer contains six of the frames which hold their insets.  In the first drawer are four wooden squares and two frames, one containing a rhomboid, the other a trapezoid. The second drawer has a series of a square and five rectangles of matching length, but different widths.  The third drawer has six circles diminishing in diameter.  The fourth has six triangles.  The fifth has five polygons from a pentagon to a decagon.   The sixth drawer has six curved figures (an ellipse, oval, and a flower like figure formed by four crossed arcs) (147-148).</li>
<li>For the insets, present the child with the large frame or tray…Take out the insets, mix them on the table, and invite the child to replace them.  Children expend energy in recognizing the form (148).</li>
<li>After 3-4 lessons, the child recognized the geometric figures easily and places the insets with security/nonchalance.  At this point, one can help the child engage in a methodical observation of the forms (148).</li>
<li>In the first period of these lessons, the child makes repeated trials…Recognition is helped by associating with the visual sense the muscular-tactile perception of the forms.  The child should be taught to run the index finger of his hand upon the edge/contour of the piece, then with the contour of the frame…make this a habit for the child (148).</li>
<li>Many children who can’t recognize a figure by sight can recognize it through touch.  Touch helps the child place the piece in its corresponding frame (148).</li>
<li>“Undoubtedly, the association of the muscular-tactile sense with that of vision, aids in a most remarkable way the perception of forms and fixes them in memory…Control is absolute” (148).</li>
<li>The absoluteness of the control allows the child to work successfully by himself, and to accomplish a sensorial auto-education (148).</li>
<li>Matching solid shapes to their 2D pictures…the child must arrange the shape cards in a line on the table and place the corresponding wooden shapes on the cards.  The control is in the child’s vision. First the child needs to recognize the figure, then place the wooden figure on it so perfectly that it covers the frame.  The child touches the contour of the 3D shapes and ensures it perfectly covers the base he matches to it.</li>
<li>In the second series, the figures on the cards are an outline…when the child matches the 3D shapes to these outlines, it is helping him gradually move from the concrete to the abstract.</li>
<li>The line-tracing with his index finger helps the child, leaving an impression of the figure.  The eye is involved in the work as well (148)</li>
<li>The third series involves matching the 3D shapes to their 2D form in planes drawn in black.</li>
<li>“The geometric figures in simple outline have grown out of a gradual series of representations which were concrete to vision and touch.  The representations return to the mind of the child when he performs the exercise of superimposing the corresponding wooden figures” (150).</li>
<li>The didactic education of the chromatic sense is with tablets of colored silk wrapped around small flat tablets with a wooden border for handling at either end.  The child holds the pieces by the wooden edges.</li>
<li>Eight colors each have eight different shades….black (from grey to white), red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, and brown (150).</li>
<li>For the earliest chromatic sense, the primary colors of red, blue, and yellow are matched in pairs…The number of tablets is increased until the eight colors are given all at once.  After this,</li>
<li>lighter shades can be presented.  Eventually, children can grade the various shades of a color (150-151).</li>
<li>After this, the child is given two different colors and their eight gradations and shown how to separate the groups and then arrange them in gradation.  Eventually one presents groups that are more closely related (like blue and purple, then yellow and orange) (151).</li>
<li>The guide can play a game where each child in a group selects a color, then she mixes the three groups of colors upon the table.  Each child must find their color mixed into the pile (151).</li>
<li>Children of age three can put all of the tints into gradation (151).</li>
<li>Color-memory can be aided by showing the child a shade/tint, allowing him to look at it for as long as he would like, then asking him to go to a distant table where all of the colors have been arranged, then selecting the shade that he looked at.  Children of age five especially enjoy this (151).</li>
<li>Discrimination of Sounds: These exercises are designed to draw children’s attention to the modulation and sound of a person’s voice.  The linguistic education is of utmost importance, also sensitizing the ear to such noises.</li>
<li>Only one child at a time can work with the instruments of the gradation of sounds, as silence is needed around him (152).</li>
<li>Signorina Maccheroni, Directress of the “Children’s House” in Milan, invented and manufactured the series of thirteen bells corresponding to musical octave.  The bells are identical, with the exception of one set having white bases, the other having natural bases.  They are struck individually by a mallet.  First, the child matches the bells by note/tone.  The children find distinguishing the tones challenging (153).</li>
<li>For the gradation of noises, use small boxes filled with different substances one can match by shaking the boxes and finding the two that produce matching sounds (153).</li>
<li>For the hearing lessons, have the class be silent, then  continue the work of silence…saying “St!” for silent?   Draw the children’s attention to all that can be heard while creating silence.  Then have the children close their eyes, habituating the children to immobility and silence…then gradually make sounds and noises (153).</li>
<li>Demonstrate the difference between a noise and a sound with a drum and a bell.  After establishing silence, ring well-toned bells, allowing the vibrations to go through the children.  This allows for a vibratory education of the ear/body (153).</li>
<li>“In this way one whose ear has been trained by a musical education suffers from strident or discordant noises.  I need give no illustration to make clear the importance of such education for the masses in childhood.  The new generation would be more calm, turning away from the confusion and the discordant sounds, which strike the ear today…” (154).</li>
<li>For musical education, create instruments as well as music…in addition to the discrimination of sounds, music awakens a sense of rhythm, gives the impulse toward calm and coordinate movements to the muscles (154).</li>
<li>Stringed instruments (like the harp) along with the drum and the bells are introduced as the classic three instruments of humanity (154).</li>
<li>“The teacher who turns her back upon these scholars to play (far too often badly), will never be the educator of their musical sense” (154).</li>
<li>Children should be drawn toward playing music well by the way the guide gracefully carries the instrument and plays beautiful music with it.  Touch the chords rhythmically, regulating the complexity of rhythm by age (154-155).</li>
<li>Children are not as sensitive to the musical tone as to rhythm.  Arrange dances according to the rhythm.</li>
<li>Educate the child’s muscular sense (teaching more graceful movements) (155).</li>
<li>Test children’s hearing through the use of creating perfect silence, calling the children very quietly.  Games of silence: call children’s attention to how silent you can be, maintain a pose without movement.  Invite a child to join in the game.</li>
<li>Children are interested in all the noises we make which we aren’t attuned to (as well as the noises in the environment we aren’t attuned to) and that there are degrees of silence.  The silence that can be aimed for is one in which absolutely nothing moves.  “The attention of the child is called to every part of his body in an anxious eagerness to attain to immobility” (156).</li>
<li>“The children sit fascinated by that silence as if by some conquest of their own” (156). Then, darken the room and have children close their eyes and rest their heads…..then say, “’Listen.  A soft voice is going to call your name’” (156).  Call children to you very quietly…”This voice…seems to reach the heart and to call to the soul of the child” (157)…Each child comes as quietly as possible.</li>
<li>“…(T)hey know that all will be called, ‘beginning with the most silent one in the room.’ Each one tries to be perfectly silent to receive the call (157).</li>
<li>“The children, after they had made the effort necessary to maintain silence, enjoyed the sensation, took pleasure in the silence itself.  They were like ships safe in a tranquil harbor, happy in having experienced something new, and to have won a victory over themselves.  This, indeed, was their recompense” (157).</li>
<li>“The (silence) game became constantly more perfect, until even children of three years of age remained immovable in the silence throughout the time required to call the entire forty children out of the room!” (157).</li>
<li>“I learned that the soul of the child has its own reward, its own peculiar spiritual pleasures” (157).</li>
<li>Montessori helped her students achieve perfect silence by drawing the childrens’ attention to the silence of a sleeping baby and challenged the students to be as silent as the sleeping infant.  She referred to the infant as the children’s teacher…”None of you knows how to be as quiet as she does” (157-158).</li>

<li>Under Responsive vs. Over Responsive: think of sensory system as a cup, and water as a sensory input…if you’re under responsive, it’s like you’re a big cup…keep adding water and never get full….if you’re over responsive, you have a tiny cup that gets filled too easily</li>
<li>Each of your sensory systems has its own cup and they are different sizes</li>
<li>Some days and times of the day are good and some are too much for me; I don’t like loud or busy places…I need less noise to feel in control of my body…I like to always be moving and have a hard time holding still…I don’t like being touched sometimes</li>
<li>It’s important to know your own body and seven sensory systems: sound…if it’s too loud, can’t concentrate on anything but loud noises, music makes me feel relaxed: taste and smell: chemical senses; vison: our eyes, some like bright lights and lots of things to look at…it can be too much to look at..tactile) some people don’t like to be touched, some people don’t like to be messy, certain clothes are too uncomfortable…most people’s brains get used to that, but not if you have SPD: Proprioception (body awareness); input through muscles and joints, bouncing on ball, joint compression, scootering, carrying something heavy, (getting wrapped up in a blanket helps organize input and relax); vestibular: something in our inner ear that tells the brain whether we’re balanced, moving…tells us if we’re dizzy…if our brain is underresponsive, then we we want to constantly move and never get dizzy…if overresponsive, scared of activities where we put our head back and when feet aren’t on the ground</li>

<h2 id="chapter-9-on-the-training-of-the-senses">Chapter 9: On the Training of the Senses:</h2>
<ul>
<li>“But there has not been a serious attempt to prepare a systematic method for training the senses of individuals.  Yet I believe that psychometrics should be more concerned with the DEVELOPMENT of the INDIVIDUAL than of the instrument” (168, emphasis mine).</li>
<li>“(T)he training of the senses is a matter of the greatest importance in education” (168).</li>
<li>There are biological and social aims in education.  “The biological objective is to assist the natural development of the individual; the social objective consists in preparing the individual for his environment, and this also embraces professional education, which teaches an individual how to make use of his surroundings” (168).</li>
<li>“The development of the senses actually precedes that of the higher intellectual faculties, and in a child between the ages of three to six it constitutes his formative period” (168).</li>
<li>We can therefore assist the development of the senses during this very period by graduating and adapting the stimuli to which a child is exposed just as we should assist him in learning how to speak before his speech is completely developed” (168).</li>
<li>“The education of early childhood should be based entirely upon this principle: Assist the natural development of the child” (169).</li>
<li>“The other aspect of education, namely, that of adapting an individual to his environment will be more important and later on, when the period of intensive development will have passed” (169).</li>
<li>The years of three to six are filled by rapid physical growth and the development of psychic faculties.  “During these years a child develops his senses, and his attention is therefore directed towards his environment” (169).</li>
<li>“He is attracted by stimuli than by reason.  During this period, he should be methodically exposed to stimuli that will develop his senses rationally and thus lay the foundation for his mental powers” (169).</li>
<li>“…(T)hrough the education of the senses it is possible to discover and correct positive defects which would otherwise pass unnoticed, or would only become apparent after they had become so serious that it would no longer be possible for a child to adapt himself to his surroundings because of his deafness, for example, or his poor sight” (169).</li>
<li>“It is therefore a child’s physiological education that directly prepares the way for his psychic development by perfecting his sense organs and his habits of projection and association” (169).</li>
<li>“But the other aspect of education, that which enables an individual to adapt himself to his environment, is also indirectly affected” (169).</li>
<li>“Art…is based upon the observation of truth” (169).</li>
<li>The science field advances through observation…”We should therefore engender this attitude in the oncoming generation, since it is necessary for modern civil life and an indispensable means for continuing the work of human progress” (170).</li>
<li>“The training of the senses, insofar as it makes an observer, not only fulfills the generic function of adapting him to the contemporary mode of civilization, but it also prepares him for the exigencies of life” (170).</li>
<li>“Education, for example, has always attempted to teach through an intellectual approach and then gone on to action.  As a rule when we teach we talk about objects that interest us and try to induce a pupil to carry out some task connected with them.  But frequently a student, even after he has understood something, finds it enormously difficult to execute a task he is expected to perform, since his education lacks a factor of prime importance-the perfecting of his sensations” (169-170).</li>
<li>“She will have to attain this ability through long practice, and such practice is no more than a late training of the senses, which in adults is frequently no longer effective” (170).</li>
<li>“Everyone must acquire skills through repeated exercises.  And learning of this sort includes a training of the senses that must be taken up at a later age” (171).</li>
<li>“If training of this sort is undertaken at an age when the formative period is naturally over, it will be difficult and imperfect.  The secret of preparing one for a particular skill consists in utilizing that period of life between the ages of three and six, when there is a natural inclination to perfect one’s senses and movements” (171).</li>
<li>Intellectual training which lacks the training of the senses/the attuning of the senses isn’t useful…an example being a doctor who can’t detect murmurs due to lack of auditory attunement (171).</li>
<li>“…(T)he intelligence is frequently rendered useless through lack of practice, and that this practice almost always consists in a training of the senses.  In practical life everyone needs to be able to acquire knowledge from the stimuli furnished by his environment” (172).</li>
<li>“The training of the senses must begin in the formative period of life if we wish to perfect them later through education and make use of them in any particular human skill.  This is why such training should be begun methodically in childhood and then be continued during the time when an individual is preparing himself through education for the practical life he will have to live” (172).</li>
<li>“(W)hen we think that we are completing a person’s education by providing him with an intellectual culture, we are actually making him a contemplative hardly fit for the life of men.  And then, when we wish to provide an education for the practical aspects of life, we limit ourselves to a life of action and neglect the real foundations of a practical education which would place us in direct contact with the external world” (172).</li>
<li>“(A)fter he has finished his formal education, a professional man must train his senses so that he comes into direct contact with the surrounding world” (173).</li>
<li>“Aesthetic and moral education is also closely connected with the training of the senses.  By multiplying sense experiences and developing the ability to evaluate the smallest differences in various stimuli, one’s sensibilities are refined and one’s pleasures increased.  Beauty is found in harmony, not in discord; and harmony implies affinities, but these require a refinement of the senses if they are to be perceived.  The beautiful harmonies of nature and art escape those whose senses are dull.  The world is then cramped and cruel.  Our surroundings provide us with inexhaustible sources of aesthetic pleasure” (173).</li>
<li>“Strong stimuli do not, as a matter of fact, sharpen but rather dull the senses, which as a consequence need everstronger stimuli” (173).</li>
<li>“From a psychological point of view, we can see the importance of the training of the senses by looking at the outline of the reflex are which summarizes the function of the nervous system” (173).</li>
<li>“The senses are organs for the apprehension of images of the external world necessary for the mind, just as the hand is the organ for grasping material needed by the body.  But both hand and senses can be perfected to perform much higher tasks and thus become ever more worthy servants of the spirit that retains them in its service” (173).</li>
<li>“Any real education of the intellect, should also raise the potentialities of these two faculties, which are capable of almost indefinite improvement” (173).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-10-the-teacher">Chapter 10: The Teacher:</h2>
<ul>
<li>“It is not a question of giving the child knowledge about the qualities of things, such as size, shape, and color, by means of various objects.  Nor is it her aim to train a child to use the materials correctly.  This would put our material in competition with that of others” (175).</li>
<li>“(O)ur materials are not a new means to be placed in the hands of an ‘active’ teacher to help her with her teaching.  Rather, there is a radical change in method.  Activity has hitherto been the special competence of the teacher, but in our system it is left mainly to the child” (175).</li>
<li>“The work of the teacher is divided between the teacher and the environment.  For the ‘teaching’ teacher there has been substituted a much more complex combination consisting of teacher and many different objects, and both teacher and objects cooperate in a child’s education” (175).</li>
<li>“The profound difference that exists between our method and the so called ‘objective lessons’ of the older systems is that the objects are not a help to the teacher” (175).</li>
<li>“The objects in our system are, instead, a help to the child himself.  He chooses what he wants for his own use, and works with it according to his own needs, tendencies, and special interests.  In this way the objects become a means of growth” (175).</li>
<li>“The principal agent is the object itself and not the instruction given by the teacher.  It is the child who uses the objects; it is the child who is active, and not the teacher” (175).</li>
<li>“(The teacher’s cooperation) is not all excluded, but it becomes prudent, delicate, and manifold.  She does not have need of words, or energy, or severity; but she must be able to make prudent observations, to assist a child going up to, or withdrawing from, him, and by speaking or keeping silence in accordance with his needs” (175-176).</li>
<li>The guide must emanate “tranquility, patience, charity, and humility.  Not words, but virtues, are her main qualifications” (176).</li>
<li>(The guide) “should explain the use of the material.  She is the main connecting link between the material, that is, the objects, and the child.  This is a simple, modest duty, and yet it is much more delicate than that found in the older schools” (176).</li>
<li>“In our schools a teacher does no more than facilitate and explain to a child the very active and prolonged work laid out for him in choosing objects and employing himself with them.  It is somewhat akin to what takes place in a gymnasium where both teacher and apparatus are necessary” (176).</li>
<li>“The older types of schools have failed miserably in strengthening a child’s character and personality.  Our schools, on the contrary, where the teacher restricts herself to giving guidance to children, have furnished them with a gymnasium for mental exercises.  They grow stronger, develop a distinctive personality, are well disciplined, and acquire an inward health that is the direct brilliant product of the freeing of the mind” (176).</li>
<li>“The teacher must undertake a twofold study: she must have a good knowledge of the work she is expected to do and of the function of the material, that is, of the means of a child’s development” (176).</li>
<li>“(The teacher) must fashion herself, she must learn how to observe, how to be calm, patient, and humble, how to restrain her own impulses, and how to carry out her eminently practical tasks with the required delicacy.  She too has greater need of a gymnasium for her soul than of a book for her intellect” (177).</li>
<li>“A teacher must therefore be well acquainted with the material and keep it constantly before her mind.  She must acquire a precise knowledge of the techniques that have been experimentally determined for the presentation of the material and for dealing with the child so that he is effectively guided.  All this constitutes a major part of the preparation of a teacher” (177).</li>
<li>“It is only through experience (the teacher) will acquire those delicate insights needed for treating different individuals” (177).</li>
<li>“To become acquainted with the material, a teacher should not simply look at it, study it in a book, or learn its use through the explanations of another.  Rather, she must exercise herself with it for a long time, trying in this way to evaluate her own experience the difficulties of, or the interests inherent in, each piece of material that can be given to a child, trying to interpret, although imperfectly, the impressions which a child himself can get from it” (177).</li>
<li>“(I)f a teacher has enough patience to repeat an exercise as often as a child, she can measure in herself the energy and endurance possessed by a child of a certain age.  For this final purpose, the teacher can grade the materials and thus judge the capacity of a child for a certain kind of activity at a given stage of his development” (177-178).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Maintenance of Order:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“The teacher, besides placing the child in contact with the material, also places him in contact with the order that exists in his environment.  She imposes upon him a rule that forms the basis for organized external discipline.  It is extremely simple, but sufficient to guarantee peaceful work” (178).</li>
<li>“It is that every object must have a definite place where it is kept and where it stays when not in use.  A child may take a piece of material only from the place where it is exposed for free choice, and when he has finished using it, he must put it back in its place in the same condition it was when he took it” (178).</li>
<li>“This means that no child can give up his work simply when he has satisfied his own desires; he must be willing to continue his work to the end out of respect for the environment and the rules that govern it.  A child may never pass on his material to a companion; much less may he take material for another” (178).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Perfecting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“(T)he teacher keeps watch so that a child who is absorbed in his work is not disturbed by one of his companions.  This office of being the “guardian angel” of minds concentrated on work that will improve them is one of the most solemn duties of the teacher” (178).</li>
<li>“In her duty of guiding a child in using the material, a teacher must make a distinction between two different periods.  In the first she puts the child in contact with the material and initiates him in its use.  In the second she intervenes to enlighten a child who has already succeeded in distinguishing differences through his own spontaneous efforts.  It is then that she can determine the ideas acquired by a child, if this is necessary, and provide him with words to describe the differences he has perceived” (179).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-did-it-teach-you--is-it-giving-you-a-new-awareness-of-the-sensorial-area">What did it teach you?  Is it giving you a new awareness of the Sensorial area?</h2>
<p>In considering the importance/value of the Sensorial materials and their use for the students, I was struck by the statements regarding assisting the natural development of the child (169) and adapting an individual to his environment.  It seems obvious how the sensorial materials and their sequencing would aid the children in both.  The way in which Dr. Montessori envisioned the training of the senses and prepared materials for this very purpose was based on science, and the ways in which these materials have helped young minds expand and grow over the years have been fascinating.</p>
<p>Dr. Montessori discusses the fact that mere intelligence alone can be useless if not put into practice and/or if not containing therein the basic sensorial foundation all people should be able to build upon.  Certainly one can relate to this in their thinking of an individual in their life who may have a high cognitive intelligence, but without matching sensorial intelligence/adaptations to coincide, one’s cognitive intelligence can be rendered ineffective.</p>
<p>The attunement of the senses occurs most easily and fully during the firs six years of life.  Examples of this can be found in how challenging it is when an infant/toddler experiences blindness or hearing loss/deafness during these incredibly formative years.  The repercussions of these challenges during those first six years yield the most challenging results for many reasons.  In addition, the way our minds and bodies are wired to perceive the stimuli through our senses during these formative years appears obvious as well.</p>
<p>The harmonies (and contrasting dissonances) in nature are most fully perceived through a gradual refining of one’s senses.  What awe the world has to offer as our senses become sharpened/refined and as our mind’s learn to focus and sort the various stimuli our sensory systems take in!</p>
<p>Teachers as those who meticulously arrange the environment for the exploration (and learning) of the child are those who most fully aid the child in his or her development and growth.  The teacher must understand the learning isn’t about her but originates from the child in the prepared environment.  Both the teacher and objects cooperate in the education of the child (175).  The sensorial materials allow the child to be the active learner, not merely a passive vessel, and the instruction is gained through the use of the apparatus itself, versus any verbal instruction from the guide.</p>

<ul>
<li>Developed partly from the materials used by Itard and Seguin in their education of children with disabilities.  The reactions of the children to the learning materials, the ways in which they were used, and the advantages derived from them, led to the reliable criteria…color, size, and shape were determined by experience (111).</li>
<li>“The training and sharpening of the senses has the obvious advantage of enlarging the field of perception and of offering an ever more solid foundation for intellectual growth.  The intellect builds up its store of practical ideas through contact with, and explanation of, its environment.  Without such concepts the intellect would lack precision and inspiration in its abstract operation” (111).</li>
<li>The sensorial materials aid in the training/refinement of the senses (111)</li>
<li>Prior to children joining the community at a Children’s House, they have begun developing, accumulating, and absorbing a host of impressions (111).</li>
<li>“With the gradual emergence of knowledge and volition, it becomes imperative to establish some order and clarity within the mind and to distinguish what is essential from what is accidental.  A child at this time is ready to rediscover his own environment and the inner wealth of impressions which he has of it.  To satisfy this need, he should have an exact, scientific guide, such as that which is to be found in our apparatus and exercises” (111).</li>
<li>Exercises with the sensorial materials allow one to correct any defects in the development of the senses (112)</li>
<li>“Every single group of objects represents the same quality, but in different degrees; there is consequently a regular, but gradual distinction between the various objects and, when this is possible, one that is mathematically fixed” (112).</li>
<li>Modifications may be called for based on the child’s development (112)</li>
<li>“Experience will show how only the material, which really interests a small child and which he will freely choose and regularly employ, is suitable for a child’s education” (112)</li>
<li>“Every series of objects, whether they produce sounds or represent different colors…is graded, so that there is a maximum and a minimum, which determine its limits, or which …are fixed by the use which a child makes of them.  When the two extremes are brought together, they clearly demonstrate the difference that exists within the series….sharp contrasts between the extremes make their differences evident and arouses the interest of the child” (112).</li>
<li>Isolating one sensorial quality (such as weight, texture, color, form, size, tone, etc.) and focusing the child’s attention on the one sensorial quality can be achieved through gradations, with the objects being identical with the exception of the one sensorial quality being refined through use of the material (113).</li>
<li>Music, when presented to children as toys, doesn’t lend to increasing musical perception, whereas the bells in Montessori environments, with their different notes, allows a child to refine their musical perception (113).</li>
<li>“Psychological studies have shown that it is necessary to isolate the senses as far as possible, if some quality is to be brought out” (113).</li>
<li>The subject (sense) should be isolated from every other impression, and the material graded according to a single sensorial quality (113).</li>
<li>“The perfection of this exercise consists in removing as far as possible all distracting factors.  It enables a child to engage in an inner and external analysis that can help him acquire an orderly mind.  A child is by his nature an avid explorer of his surroundings, because he has not yet had the time or means of knowing them precisely” (114).</li>
<li>“Every effort should be made to see that the materials….contain in themselves a control of error” (114)…examples: solid insets…this helps the child complete the work correctly independently and any mistakes are obvious.  It also assists the child in being accustomed to noticing mistakes.</li>
<li>The control of error helps a child develop their critical thinking</li>
<li>The whole classroom/environment should be designed in such a way that it is easy for the children to correct mistakes….”everything in the room is an informer” (115)</li>
<li>The entire environment is an instructor</li>
<li>The materials and environment should be aesthetically-pleasing and the materials should be attractive…everything should be inviting to the child(ren).</li>
<li>The materials should lend themselves to the activities of children.</li>
<li>Children enjoy making/disassembling things, placing and replacing things…children desire to be active learners.</li>
<li>The materials should be limited in quantity.</li>
<li>“A normal child does not need stimuli to awaken him or to put him in contact with the material world.  He is already awake, and already has constant, countless relations with his environment.  He needs rather to bring order into the chaos, created in his mind by the host of sensations coming to him from the outside world” (117).</li>
<li>Children are explorers of their world and need the paths that point them towards their goals… “He..passionately attaches himself to those things, limited and direct in scope, which bring order into the chaos that has been created within him; and with this order, they provide light for his exploring mind and a guide for his researches” (117).</li>
<li>If children have too many objects/materials in their environment, it creates chaos/discouragement (and overstimulation).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-7-the-exercises-how-a-teacher-should-give-a-lesson-comparison-with-the-older-systems">Chapter 7: The Exercises: How a Teacher Should Give a Lesson: Comparison with the Older Systems:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The sensorial lessons are given individually, the teacher approaches this cautiously, merely beginning by picking up a material that she thinks might interest the child</li>
<li>The lesson is as if the guide is making experiments, calling the child’s attention to the material…if it meets the child’s needs, this leads to prolonged working with the material</li>
<li>One might present without even speaking, and if one must speak, words should be carefully selected and used with care (not too wordy)… “the fewer the words, the more perfect will be the lesson” (118).</li>
<li>Lessons should be simple/contain nothing but the absolute truth</li>
<li>Lessons should be objective.  The attention of the child should be entirely on the object (avoid attention on the guide)</li>
<li>Guides note the child’s interest (or not), the duration of his interest, and not attempt to force the child’s interest…if not understood by the child, the guide need not insist on repeating the lesson and should not let the child know he has made a mistake/has not understood</li>
<li>If a child makes a mistake with the materials, the guide doesn’t need to repeat the lesson right away or corrects, but merely puts that material away for the time-being (119).</li>
<li>Practice avoiding overwhelming children with too many words/too much information.</li>
<li>Keep lessons simple/matter-of-fact (example: “This is blue” to a blue tile, “This is red” to a red tile)….</li>
<li>Children’s eyes are attuned to the various shapes in their environment….help make certain shapes stand out in order to have that shape make an impression on the child.</li>
<li>“This is our mission: to cast a ray of light and pass on” (124).</li>
<li>“This, then, is the first duty of an educator: to stir up life, but leave it free to develop.  For such a delicate mission there is need, however, of a great art, which will suggest the proper time and limits of one’s own interventions.  This will prevent the teacher from disturbing or misdirecting, instead of assisting, a soul, which is coming to life and which will live by virtue of its own efforts” (124).</li>
<li>Once a guide has made an impression on children’s hearts, and single words will be enough to capture their attention and invite them to listen</li>
<li>Guides should be regarded as ones who give children life (124)</li>
<li>“As far as child psychology is concerned, we are more prejudiced than wise.  Up till now we have wanted to dominate children externally with the rod, instead of trying to subdue them by guiding them inwardly like human beings” (125).</li>
<li>“But if we set aside the tricks with which we have tried to ensnare them and the violence, which we took for discipline, they reveal themselves to us under another aspect.  Their gentleness is sweet and absolute, and their love of knowledge is such that it enables them to overcome obstacles (125).</li>
<li>One begins introducing the sensorial materials with a very few contrasting stimuli, and gradually the child can be given larger numbers of similar objects…ex. for the tactile discrimination, begin with only the two most extreme conditions in the set…the roughest and the most smooth….</li>
<li>Seriation is another type of material….series of objects that are mixed together being placed randomly, then organized into a graded order</li>
<li>Various exercises in the Montessori primary programs prepare them indirectly and remotely for writing</li>
<li>Have children wash their hands well before trying to discriminate the type of material by using their sense of touch…also one can teach the children to work with their eyes closed.</li>
<li>“The various exercises that the children perform with their hands prepare them indirectly and directly for writing” (127).</li>
<li>Collections of the following: cards of varying grade of smoothness, sandpaper cards of graded coarseness, different types of fabric (satin, cotton, velvet, wool, etc.)….have these arranged sometimes according to pairs, sometimes according to series….children can do this blindfolded to focus all of their attention on the tactile sensations</li>
<li>Fill metal/stainless steel bottles up with different temperatures of water (a pair of each temperature) to be matched, seriated from hot to col</li>
<li>For weight/baric senses, rectangular tablets of wood of various weight/density can be matched/seriated…the child places one in each hand (with palms flat) and compares weight….</li>
<li>Muscular memory can be built when children practice identifying shapes with the eyes closed/blindfolded and tracing the sides of the shape</li>
<li>“When we touch something as we move, two sensations, tactile and muscular, are mixed together, and give rise to that sense, which psychologists call the ‘stereognostic sense’” (131).</li>
<li>Knowledge gained from the tactile and muscular senses can be integrated and one has a more exact perception of an object</li>
<li>Little children touch everything they see!  (132)…”It is the obvious expression of a very keen muscular sensibility, which a small child possesses at the period of his life in which the basic coordination of his movements is being fixed”</li>
<li>Kinesthetic intelligence is utilized with all of the sensorial materials, as they all involve movements of the muscles/body of some kind</li>
<li>An example was given of Frobel’s blocks and bricks activity: children sorting each into different piles while blindfolded…blocks on the right, bricks on the left….this kept the child’s attention focused…”A child has to recognize the form and remember the portion assigned to the different objects throughout the exercise” (133).</li>
<li>“These exercises for the stereognostic sense can be widely extended.  They are a great delight to the children, since they are not concerned with the perception of a single stimulus, such as that of heat, but rather with the reconstruction of a whole, well-known object….They ultimately gain the ability to distinguish objects that are small and closely related, like birdseed and rice” (133).</li>
<li>“Children are proud to be able to ‘see’ without their eyes” (133).</li>
<li>Children began using all of the materials again stereognostically, where they recognized by touch the solid insets, geometric plaques, and the three series of blocks (134).</li>
<li>One can help refine child’s senses of smell and taste…examples of smells include fresh flowers, fresh cut grass…one can make sachets with different flowers and herbs, eventually scents as strong as pine, in them for children to smell</li>
<li>“When a child’s attention is directed in an orderly fashion towards the exercises of his various senses, even the sense of smell becomes more ‘intelligent,’ and thus, also an instrument for the exploration of his environment” (136).</li>
<li>Help children identify/differentiate the four different basic flavors of sweet, salty, sour, and bitter</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Practical life activities are not a prerequisite for the Sensorial activities, but rather a companion to these materials.  Coordination, concentration, independence, and order are all part of the child’s work cycle regardless of the nature of the work.</li>
<li>All the materials in the Sensorial Curriculum have the same developmental aim – refinement of the ability to:
<ol>
<li>Observe</li>
<li>Compare</li>
<li>Differentiate</li>
<li>Reason</li>
<li>Solve problems</li>
<li>Appreciate and participate in the world.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There are methods within the materials that develop the child’s intellect and reason.  The refinement of the senses follows this basic order:
<ol>
<li>Perception of differences/recognition of contrasts (sorting)</li>
<li>Perception of similarities/recognition of identities (matching)</li>
<li>Discrimination between ends of a spectrum (preparation for grading)</li>
<li>Perception of minute differences between similar objects (grading)</li>
<li>Recall of sensory perceptions (memory games)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The materials are grouped according to the sense.  No one sense is necessarily a preparation of another sense, so that children may be working in several sense areas at a time.</li>
<li>The materials isolate the sense.  Whenever possible, all other sensory clues are removed.  If a child is touching fabrics, encourage the use of a blindfold so that the visual difference between the fabrics is not a clue.</li>
<li>Within each sense sequence, the activities isolate the level of difficulty.  Materials progress from simple to complex.</li>
<li>Within the activity, isolate the extremes of gradation.</li>
<li>Sensorial materials are auto-educational. The beauty of the materials calls the child and the control of error allows the child to identify and correct mistakes through an act of will. It is this independent self-correction that leads the child to mastery.</li>
<li>The materials encourage repetition through variations.</li>
<li>Through extensions, the child applies the skill and knowledge acquired by the activity in new ways. This creative application leads the child on to new discoveries and new materials.</li>
<li>After the child&rsquo;s exploration of the material, language is introduced through Seguin&rsquo;s Three Period Lesson. Language is the bridge between the concrete and the abstract, the experience and the thought.</li>
<li>Remember that all the materials involve the use of the senses, the mind and the hand. Sensory and motor activity supply the mind with information.</li>
<li>The materials are sequential. The progression on the shelves moves left to right, top to bottom. (see additional Sequencing List below)</li>

<p>These materials refine the child&rsquo;s visual discrimination of size. Initially, the control of error is built into the material with the Knobbed Cylinders. All the subsequent materials develop the child&rsquo;s eye as the control of error. The purpose of the materials is not that the child initially grade the objects correctly but, rather, train the eye through the trial and error of repetition.<br>
⇒ The Knobless Cylinders are the most difficult in this sequence since their differences are less dramatic, less obvious than the cubes, prisms and rods. All these materials are sets of 10.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Stand and view tower of cubes from all sides and from top looking down.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<img class="float-right" src="http://example.org/img/sensorial/image048.webp" alt="Pink Tower Presentation Again">

<ol start="10">
<li>
<p>Beginning with the smallest cube, disassemble the tower, one cube at a time, moving each cube to a position near the center of the rug.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning with the largest cube, return each cube one at a time to its original placement in the classroom in a constructed tower, with the largest cube on the bottom and the smallest cube on the top.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Can isolate extremes for students at first, or focus on 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 pieces….assemble laying down on rug first, then assemble vertically, can variate it by pushing the cubes flush by the sides (instead of in the center, too), can slide the smallest cube down the side overlay; can have child close their eyes, take one, and child has to see where the tower is missing a piece; demonstrate taking the tower down one cube at a time: discuss how it’s painted so beautifully and if you knock it down, it will chip the paint</p>
<p><em>After presentation 1 start to add language.</em></p>
<p><strong>Points of Interest:</strong> Varying size in three dimensions.  Uniformity of shape and color.  Varying weight of cubes.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>  Geometric Solids</p>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong> learn the shapes and names of the geometric solids</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Aims:</strong> Through exploration and discovery, the child develops and refines the ability to observe, compare, differentiate, reason, decide, solve problems, appreciate and participate in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 3-5 </p>
<p><strong>Presentation I:  (Demonstration Tray)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bring the demonstration tray of the Geometric Cabinet to the mat.  Place it in the central portion of the mat.</li>
<li>Beginning with the leftmost inset, remove it from the tray using the fingers of the dominant hand in a three-finger pincer grip</li>
<li>Lift the inset carefully and place it in the blank frame (either above or beneath) the inset.</li>
<li>Continue with the other two insets.  Observe.</li>
<li>Replace the insets in their respective frames.</li>
<li>Return the demonstration tray to its original position.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Presentation II:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully remove one drawer from the Geometric Cabinet and bring it to the mat.</li>
<li>One at a time, remove the insets in a manner described in the previous presentation. Place them beneath the drawer.</li>
<li>Repeat the procedure until all insets are removed.  Observe.</li>
<li>Beginning with the leftmost inset, replace them in their original positions in the drawer.</li>
<li>Return the drawer to its original position in the Geometric Cabinet.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Presentation III:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully remove one drawer from the Geometric Cabinet and bring it to the mat.</li>
<li>One at a time, remove the insets one at a time and scatter them randomly beneath the drawer.</li>
<li>By comparison, grade the insets (largest to smallest for circles or quadrilaterals; fewest to greatest number of sides for polygons). Observe.</li>
<li>One at a time, return the insets to their original positions in their frames in the drawer.</li>
<li>Return the drawer to its original position in the Geometric Cabinet.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Points of Interest:</strong> The quantity of different sized similar shapes and the quantity and diversity of shapes in the cabinet</p>
<p><strong>Control of Error:</strong>  Each inset has its own frame in the drawer</p>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong>  Trace the frames and/or insets. Move the frames as well as the insets from the drawer to the mat. Stack the insets and/or frames.</p>
<p><strong>Extensions:</strong>  Find the geometric shapes elsewhere in the classroom, in nature, in books or photographs.  Trace the insets and/or frames on paper.
Make booklets. Use scissors or push pin to cut out or punch the various shapes. Label the geometric shapes.  Use with the cards for the Geometric Cabinet</p>
<p><strong>Vocabulary:</strong>   circle, rectangle, triangle
equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle, scalene triangle, right angled triangle, obtuse angled triangle, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon, oval, ellipse, curvilinear triangle, quatrefoil, rhombus, trapezoid, parallelogram, quadrilateral</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong>  The procedure for tracing frames and insets is as follows:
• For the frame: Using the two first fingers of the dominant hand, begin at the 1:00 position and move fingers in a counterclockwise direction around the outer edge of the frame.
• For the inset: Grasp the inset knob with the subdominant hand. Beginning at the 7:00 position and using the first two fingers of the dominant hand, trace around the outer edge of the inset in a counterclockwise direction.
Remember that the child will gain more concrete information about the shape by tracing the frame.</p>

<h3 id="cards-for-the-geometric-cabinet">CARDS FOR THE GEOMETRIC CABINET</h3>

<img class="float-right" src="http://example.org/img/sensorial/image084.webp" alt="Child working with Shapes">

<p><strong>Materials:</strong>  Geometric Cabinet - drawers 1 - 6; cards (3 sets of cards representing the figures of the Geometric Cabinet. There are 3 sets for each drawer: full surface, thick line, thin line). Several rugs</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Geometric Solids and Bases; Geometric Cabinet demonstration tray and at least one drawer</p>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong> Associate three dimensional shapes with two dimensional shapes</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Aims:</strong>
Through exploration and discovery, the child develops and refines the ability to observe, compare, differentiate, reason, decide, solve problems, appreciate and participate in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 3-5 </p>
<p><strong>Presentation I:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bring one drawer of the Geometric Cabinet to the mat.  Remove the insets, one at a time, in the manner described in the previous lesson plan.  Place the insets along the top left edge of the mat.</li>
<li>Place the empty drawer on a smaller mat placed to the right of the larger mat.</li>
<li>Beginning with the full surface cards, and using a comparison procedure, place them one at a time from left to right directly beneath the already placed insets.</li>
<li>Check the match of the cards with the insets by placing the inset directly on the cards.  Using a 3-finger pincer grip, pick up the insets, one at a time, aligning the inset on the cards.  A small border of the blue color will be visible on all sides of a correctly placed inset.</li>
<li>Repeat this comparison/matching procedure until all the insets are correctly placed.</li>
<li>Observe.  Remove the insets, one at a time, from left to right, and return them to their appropriate frames in the drawer.</li>
<li>Collect the cards from left to right, and return them to their original place in the classroom.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Presentation II:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Follow steps 1 - 5 with the full surface cards.</li>
<li>Following the already established method, add the second set (thick line) of cards.</li>
<li>Move the insets from the full surface cards to the correct thick line cards. Observe.</li>
<li>Return the insets and the cards in an orderly fashion to their appropriate places in the classroom.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Presentation III:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Add the third set (thin line) of cards to the work.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Points of Interest:</strong>  cards themselves: solid, thick and thin lines. Each inset has three matching cards. The work takes up a lot of space and feels like a “ big” work.</p>
<p><strong>Control of Error:</strong>    Cards will accommodate and match only one set</p>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong>  Different configurations of the cards and insets.  Different layouts of cards and insets. Add frames to the layout. Also, variations mentioned in the previous lesson plan.</p>
<p><strong>Extensions:</strong>  mentioned in the previous lesson plan</p>
<p><strong>Vocabulary:</strong>  Names of shapes and (insets) in plane; thick line, thin line</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong> Give the child an orderly, controllable way to approach this work. Move- slowly!</p>

<h3 id="tips-for-understanding-the-triangle-boxes">TIPS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE TRIANGLE BOXES</h3>
<ol>
<li>These boxes are for understanding RELATIONSHIPS between figures.</li>
<li>We show these relationships when we SUPERIMPOSE the whole on the parts and/or the parts on other parts that make the whole.</li>
<li>There are multiple ways to make the same whole.
<ol>
<li>Triangle box: WHOLE TO PART FOCUS: Superimposition of the whole (large gray) equilateral triangle on the other three ways (parts) to make an equilateral triangle [2 Rt. triangles, 3 isosceles &amp; 4 small equilaterals]. See visual that accompanies lesson.</li>
<li>Large hexagon: PART TO WHOLE FOCUS: Superimposition of whole (large yellow) triangle on three isosceles (yellow) triangles (this is the same as one of the concept/relationships as the Triangle box - just repeated because the same relationship exists for the hexagon). After bringing them all down, superimpose the equilateral triangle made of the three isosceles (yellow) triangles on the hexagon. Then, superimposed the parallelogram (red) on the base of hexagon. Then, superimpose the two isosceles (gray) triangles above (adjacent to) the parallelogram (red). See visual that accompanies lesson. To remember that the first three yellow isosceles triangles start the line up at the top of the rug, think of: Hexagon: House (three gables of a house). 😊</li>
<li>Small hexagon: PART TO WHOLE FOCUS: The line up at the top of the rug is parts to whole – 6 isosceles triangles (red) to make three parallelograms that make a hexagon. This is a concept/ relationship from the large hexagon box with the red parallelogram – presented again. But now, we see that three equal parallelograms will make a hexagon. Three small equilateral triangles make a trapezoid (concept seen in triangle box 1) and the gray equilateral triangles make two trapezoids which together make a hexagon. This box shows that 3 equal parallelograms can make a hexagon and 2 trapezoids (each made of 3 equilateral triangles) can make a hexagon. The green triangles show the trapezoid “parts” and the trapezoid is part of the (whole) hexagon. 😊</li>
<li>Rectangular box: PART TO WHOLE FOCUS: The line up at the top of the rug is easiest to remember by smallest figures to largest figures. This box is about making rectangles out of triangles. The parallelogram and the trapezoid point to the unique properties of right triangles. These right triangles (that are 45/45/90) have varying heights and bases but all make rectangles when the hypotenuses are put together. Remember that a square is rectangle (a figure with 4 right angles); it is just a special rectangle whose sides as all equal.</li>

<h3 id="matching-and-sorting-baskets">MATCHING AND SORTING BASKETS</h3>

<img class="float-right" src="http://example.org/img/sensorial/image153.webp" alt="Sorting Trinkets">

<p>These baskets of (ideally seasonal and natural) objects offer an application of the development and refinement of the three aspects of the visual sense: size, color and form.  The children apply their observation, comparison and differentiation skills AND learn the matching, sorting and grading systems with objects. See the Introduction for notes on systems for grading and matching. Some of systems will be needed for the upcoming exercises in Auditory, Tactile and Olfactory lessons.
SORTING: Basket of different shaped/ kinds of shells that are for sorting: 4-5 different shells in pairs or threes is Ok too.
MATCHING: Basket of similar shaped/kinds of shells that have minute/subtle differences but can be matched according to various methods: size; color; attributes; texture and form. This work is very subjective and allows the child to match the objects according to a one common element that they choose. For example, the sample leaves, light and dark of the same leaf that could be laminated and placed in a basket. (You can laminate leaves!)</p>

<h2 id="auditory">Auditory</h2>
<h3 id="silence">Silence</h3>
<p>Making silence, a well-known part of the Montessori method, allows the children to control their will, their bodies and to focus on their sense of hearing.</p>
<p>Montessori writes in Discovery of the Child that silence is traditionally perceived as a cessation or negation of confusion whereas in a Montessori classroom, silence is a temporary transcendence of the normal course of things   Silence in a traditional setting is often imposed and it lies in contrast to confusion and disorder or worse, as a punishment. Montessori&rsquo;s silence is a pleasurable game, a self-challenge and finally, an activity that allows the children to see the dignity in each person, especially of themselves.</p>
<p>One of the most successful Silence lessons that Montessori ever had is recounted in The Discovery of the Child when she brings in a four-month-old baby into Children&rsquo;s House.   She challenges them to be as still as the baby is since listening to a baby&rsquo;s breathing is a most pleasurable sound. Montessori asks the children to be a still as the baby, with their feet, hands, etc. They willingly accept the challenge and immediately try to be still and quiet. On other occasions, Maria Montessori would simply make silence herself in a chair, sitting quietly and immobile.  Gradually the children noticed her silence and stillness and again they did the same.</p>
<p>When all the children were still, she introduced &ldquo;the call&rdquo; when she whispers their name from a different place in the room or in an adjoining room.  They very carefully and quietly answered the call and went to the voice and then returned to their places. I have varied this Call Lesson to offer a hug to the child if they would like and then return to their places. (Be sure to have a complete list of all the children present so as to not skip a child.) Silence is a time when the teacher and the students find a union. Montessori explains that her children were more obedient and gentler after games of Silence.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> With both Auditory and Olfactory exercises it is recommended to introduce some preliminary exercises (individual and/ or group or small group) prior to the Montessori material.</p>

<img class="float-right" src="http://example.org/img/sensorial/image157.webp" alt="Silence Book">
</p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong>  Candle and match/lighter and snuffer</p>
<p><strong>Presentation I:</strong>
Present to the group. Light candle. After lighting the candle ask the children to sit quietly and listen. The silence book is read. The story of Montessori holding a baby and the baby falling asleep and the class listening to the silence of the sleeping baby can also be told. The class should remain silent until the candle is put out. Hand the snuffer to a child and ask them to put it out.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation II:</strong>  The silence book is on a tray and can be taken to a table and read.  A younger child can ask an adult or older child to read the silence book to them.  The younger child may also be able to understand the book from the pictures. The child makes silence.  An extension could be making a silence book to take home.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong>  Sign that is labeled &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; and a picture of a child who doesn’t like the noise; perhaps with hands over his ears</p>
<p><strong>Presentation:</strong> Show the children at group the image of a child upset at the noise level. Read the words on the image. Show the children where this image is kept and how they may use it. For example, when the noise level gets loud or uncomfortable for a child in the class, they can go and get the silence sign and take it to the part of the room that is loud. The request must be respected to bring down the room noise level.</p>

<p><strong>Comments:</strong>  Watch how the children respond to each other.  We also have a class &ldquo;Peace Keeper&rdquo; just in case the group that you are trying to get quiet will not listen.  The child can go to the &ldquo;Peace Keeper&rdquo; if they can&rsquo;t get cooperation from the other children to be quiet.</p>

<h3 id="sound-cylinders">SOUND CYLINDERS</h3>

<img class="float-right" src="http://example.org/img/sensorial/image163.webp" alt="Sound Cylinders">

<p><strong>Materials:</strong>  Two matched sets of six cylinders, each filled with different materials so that the range of sound goes from loud to quiet when shaken.  Mat or table</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Sound and no sound basket</p>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong> discrimination and matching of sounds</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Aims:</strong> Through exploration and discovery, the child develops and refines the ability to observe, compare, differentiate, reason, decide, solve problems, appreciate and participate in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 4 +</p>
<p><strong>Presentation I:</strong>
(three extremes: loudest, medium, quiet) Comparison and matching</p>
<ol>
<li>Bring one of the boxes containing the sound cylinders to the workspace (blue box).  Place in the central portion of the workspace.</li>
<li>Bring the second box (red box) to the table and place it to the right of the already-placed   box.</li>
<li>Open the box to the left.  Place the box lid to the left of that box.</li>
<li>Open the box to the right.  Place the box lid to the right of that box.</li>
<li>Pick up a sound cylinder from the box on the left (blue).  Holding it lightly by the fingertips of the dominant hand, shake it gently in an up and down motion near one ear, then the other.  Place this cylinder on the table in front of its box.  This is the control.</li>
<li>Pick up a cylinder from the box on the right (red).  Shake it in the same manner as described in step 5.  If the sound is the same as the control cylinder, they match. (You might need to re-shake the control cylinder to check the match.)  The matched pair is placed in the upper left corner of the workspace, side by side.</li>
<li>If the second (red) cylinder does not match the control, place it (the red cylinder) on the box lid on the right.</li>
<li>Sound the blue control cylinder again.  Choose another red cylinder and compare it to the first (control). When a match is found, all the cylinders on the red box lid are returned to the box.</li>
<li>Repeat the match/discard procedure until all the cylinders are paired and matched.</li>
<li>Return all the cylinders to their boxes one at a time from left to right, top to bottom.</li>
<li>Replace the box lids one at a time, then return the boxes to their original positions on the shelf.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Presentation II: (three extremes)  Grading</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bring one box of the sound cylinders to the workspace. Open the box and place the lid to the right of the box.</li>
<li>Pick up a cylinder. Sound it in the manner described in the previous presentation. Gauge its sound - loud or quiet -and place it in front of the box.</li>
<li>Pick up another cylinder from the box.  Sound it and then sound the first cylinder again, looking for the louder of the two.  Place the louder cylinder in the upper left corner of the workspace.</li>
<li>Shake the remaining cylinder (the second one).  Remove the third cylinder from the box and, by comparison, find the louder of these two.  Place this cylinder to the right of the already placed cylinder at the top of the workspace.</li>
<li>Compare the second-placed cylinder to the first chosen one.  The louder of these two cylinders should be place in the upper left corner of the workspace and the quieter of the two, to the right.</li>
<li>Compare the remaining cylinder to make sure that it is the quietest of the three.  The cylinders should be arranged (from left to right) from loudest to quietest.</li>
<li>Return the cylinders to the box. Replace the lid on the box and return the box to the shelf.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Points of Interest:</strong>  Sounds in cylinders; variations in sounds</p>
<p><strong>Control of Error:</strong>  Built into the materials.</p>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong>  Add more cylinders.</p>
<p><strong>Extensions:</strong>  Make own cylinders (use spice boxes).  Look for loud and quiet sounds in the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Vocabulary:</strong>  same, different, louder, quieter</p>

<p><strong>Materials:</strong> Box divided into three compartments that contain the baric tablets: three (heavy, medium, light) grades of wooden tablets that vary in color and weight.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> heavy and light basket; scale</p>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong> perceive differences in weight</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Aims:</strong> Through exploration and discovery, the child develops and refines the ability to observe, compare, differentiate, reason, decide, solve problems, appreciate and participate in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Note on this Presentation:</strong></p>

<img class="float-right" src="http://example.org/img/sensorial/image182.webp" alt="Baric Tablets Closeup">

<p>Originally this work was done differently from all other Sensorial lessons: it was a one-on-one lesson with an adult and one child. Because of this requirement, the work was difficult to do on a regular basis. Also, many children and adults have a challenging time differentiating the blocks of wood except for a few samples of the extremes. However, this work does not follow the pattern or system of pairing tablets, so this also confuses students and adults. Needless to say, the baric tablet work with wood block samples is probably one of the most least-used works of all the Montessori materials. However, an effective and ironic solution for baric exercise is to use the thermic tablets for weight exercises since they lend themselves so perfectly to weight analysis.</p>
<p>The first and second presentations are to sensorially feel the weight differences, match and then grade one set of them following the typical Sensorial systems. For example, as in the Rough and Smooth tablets.  A third presentation is to do the work blindfolded and finally, a fourth presentation is to use a mystery bag. This final presentation could be furthered varied by combining it with a memory game and a peer: Feel the weight with the eyes closed, then walk across the room and find the same weight in the mystery bag. Below is the lesson of the wooden baric tablets that has been adjusted from the original version to comply with the similar systems in Sensorial.</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 4+ </p>
<p><strong>Presentation I: Heavy and light tablets (three of each)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bring the box containing the heavy and light Baric Tablets to the work space. Remove the tablets from the box, mixing the tablets.  Place the stack of tablets in the central portion of the work space.  Remove the box to the lower right corner of the work space.</li>
<li>Using the subdominant hand, pick up the first tablet in the stack.   Place the tablets on the upturned fingers of the dominant hand.   Using an up and down motion from the elbow and with the wrist held firm, gauge the relative weight of the tablet.  This is the control.</li>
<li>Pick up the second tablet and, using the same motion as described in step 2, decide if the second tablet weighs the same as the first.</li>
<li>If the second tablet is the same as the first, place it to the left of the stack.</li>
<li>If the second tablet differs in weight from the first, place it to the right of the stack. Always return to the control between each test.</li>
<li>Continue the process of comparison until all the tablets are sorted, then place the control on the stack to the left.</li>
<li>Return the tablets to the box, and return the box to the shelf.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Presentation II: heavy, medium and light tablets (three of each)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bring the box containing the heavy, medium and light tablets to the workspace.  Remove the tablets from the box, mixing the tablets. Place the stack of tablets in the central portion of the workspace.  Remove the box to the lower right portion of the workspace.</li>
<li>Using the procedure described above, gauge the relative weight of the first tablet in the stack.  This is the control.</li>
<li>One at a time, test each of the tablets in the stack to find those tablets that weigh the same as the control. Always return to the control between tests.</li>
<li>As tablets that weigh the same as the control are found, place them in the upper left comer of the workspace, side by side, from left to right, then place the control to the right of these tablets.  Discards are placed to the right of the stack.</li>
<li>Returning to the stack, gauge the relative weight of the tablet on the top of the stack.</li>
<li>Follow the steps in Presentation 1 to test and discover the tablets that weigh the same as the control.</li>
<li>The process of comparison will result in two stacks of tablets. These may be placed side by side in two rows beneath the already placed tablets in the top left comer of the workspace.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Points of Interest:</strong>  wearing a blindfold, cooperative work, feel of different weights</p>
<p><strong>Control of Error:</strong> peer, teacher and design of the material</p>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong>  Use more tablets.  Gauge the weight of tablets with the subdominant hand. Close eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Extensions:</strong>  Use blindfold.  Use balance scale.  Find objects in the environment that weigh the same as the three grades of tablets.</p>
<p><strong>Vocabulary:</strong>  heavy, light, heavier, lighter</p>

<img class="float-right preview-lg" src="http://example.org/img/sensorial/image183.webp" alt="Weighing Scale Closeup">

<p><strong>Materials:</strong> Balance Scale with a basket  of items from the classroom to weigh. Begin by using the thickest cylinder of Block #1 for the control weight. Then transition to other control weights after they know the lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> heavy and light basket</p>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong> compare the weight of various objects</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Aims:</strong> Through exploration and discovery, the child develops and refines the ability to observe, compare, differentiate, reason, decide, solve problems, appreciate and participate in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 3-6 </p>
<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bring tray with scale and basket to table or rug.</li>
<li>Remove the basket from tray and place it in lower right comer.</li>
<li>Remove the card from the tray and read it saying, &ldquo;This says ‘heavier.’&rdquo; Place it on the left. Remove the second card, read it saying, &ldquo;This says’ lighter.’&rdquo; Place it to the right of the other card.</li>
<li>Remove a light item from the basket and place in the left-hand plate (ie: Block * ` Thickest cylinder) saying &ldquo;this is my control.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Draw attention to the bowl going down slightly.</li>
<li>Say &ldquo;I am looking for something that is heavier&rdquo;</li>
<li>Choose another object (a heavier one such as a metal inset) and place it in the other bowl while the cylinder is still there.</li>
<li>Draw attention to how the bowl holding the metal inset went right to the ground.</li>
<li>Say &ldquo;The metal inset is heavier.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Remove the metal inset and place it under the word card that says &ldquo;heavier&rdquo;</li>
<li>Remove another object from the basket, place in the bowl opposite to the cylinder.  Observe the result and place it under appropriate word card. (NOTE: it is advisable to give the lesson with several heavier objects in a row and then to choose a light so as to see the extremes)</li>
<li>Remove all objects from the basket comparing them to the one object on the left-hand plate, in this case the thickest cylinder in knobbed cylinders Block * .</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Presentation II:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bring tray with scale and basket to table or rug.</li>
<li>Remove the basket from tray and place it in lower right comer.</li>
<li>Remove the cards from the tray and read it saying, &ldquo;This says lighter.&rdquo; Place it on the left. Remove the second card, read it saying, &ldquo;This says heavier.&rdquo; Place it to the right of the other card.</li>
<li>Remove a heavy item from the basket and place in the left-hand bowl (ie: bean bag) saying &ldquo;this is my control&rdquo;</li>
<li>Draw attention to the bowl going way down.</li>
<li>Say &ldquo;I am looking for something that is lighter&rdquo;</li>
<li>Choose another object (ie. a ten bar) and place it in the other bowl while the bean bag is still there.</li>
<li>Draw attention to how the bowl holding the bean bag did not go up.</li>
<li>Say &ldquo;The ten bar is lighter.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Remove the ten bar and place it under the word card that says &ldquo;lighter&rdquo;</li>
<li>Remove another object, place in on plate opposite to the bean bag</li>
<li>Observe the result and place it under appropriate word card. (NOTE: it is advisable to give the lesson with several light objects in a row and then to choose a heavy so as to see the sudden difference)</li>
<li>Remove all objects from the basket comparing them to the one control object</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Presentation II: (add card saying &ldquo;weighs the same&rdquo; and some new objects of equal weight)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bring tray with scale and basket to table or rug.</li>
<li>Remove the basket from tray and place it in lower right comer.</li>
<li>Remove each card from the tray, read it, and lay it out.  Say &ldquo;This says lighter&rdquo; and place to the far left. Say &ldquo;This says heavier&rdquo; and place to the right of the previous one. Say &ldquo;This says weighs the same&rdquo; and place to the right of the previous card.</li>
<li>Remove the control item from the basket and place in the left-hand bowl (ie: the thickest cylinder or a geometric solid) saying &ldquo;this is my control. &quot;</li>
<li>Draw attention to the bowl going way down.</li>
<li>Say &ldquo;I am looking for something that weighs the same&rdquo;</li>
<li>Choose another object (a predetermined object that weighs the same) and place it in the other plate while the bean bag is still there.</li>
<li>Draw attention to how the 2 bowls are equal in position and level. Say &ldquo;They weigh the same).&rdquo;</li>
<li>Remove the chosen object and place it under the word card that says &ldquo;weighs the same&rdquo;</li>
<li>Remove another object, place in the bowl opposite to the bean bag. Observe the result and place it under appropriate word card. Remove all objects from the basket comparing them to the one control object</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Points of Interest:</strong>   the shift of weight and the movement of the plates.  Use objects in the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Control of Error:</strong>  the scale itself</p>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use a heavy object in Presentation I and look for lighter.</li>
<li>Use any combination of the wooden weights provided with the scale as the control.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Extensions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Record the results on a piece of paper</li>
<li>Have the scale disassembled in a basket and give a lesson on how to put it together drawing attention to the midpoint.</li>
<li>Connect this lesson with a science lesson on gravity.</li>
<li>Introduce units of measurement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vocabulary:</strong>  heavy, light, heavier, lighter, weighs the same, to weigh</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong> This lesson requires careful preparation of the objects to be weighed. We enjoy seeing how the metal insets compare to pink tower cubes.</p>

            <h4>There are Montessori bottles/canisters that are insulated for thermic exercises. However, they are cost prohibitive for many schools. These bottles shown are an alternative, but they will not keep the liquid/solid hot or cold for long. After a morning work cycle, the bottles will likely be room temperature. But, this is a whole other lesson in and of itself! Thermic exercises are often linked to science, observation and experimentation.</h4>

<img class="float-right" src="http://example.org/img/sensorial/image186.webp" alt="Thermic Tablets">

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Although the thermic tablets can be used for temperature grading and matching, ironically, they are also used for baric since the wooden baric tablets are challenging for both children and teachers as explained above and the diversity of weights of the materials conforms to that lesson well.</p>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong> Thermic tablets: box containing two matched sets of pairs of various materials (felt, wood, steel, slate, glass, cork).</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Thermic Bottles</p>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong> Sense through touch the varying degrees of temperature</p>

<p><strong>Age:</strong> 3½ + </p>
<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bring the box containing the Thermic Tablets to the mat.  Remove them from the box one at a time, then mix the tablets randomly.  Stack them in the central portion of the workspace.  Move the box to the lower right corner of the workspace.</li>
<li>Pick up the first tablet.  Feel it to gauge its temperature on various parts of the body.  Place this tablet below the stack.  This is the control. Pick up a second tablet.  Feel and compare to the first.  If they match, place side by side in the upper left corner of the workspace.</li>
<li>If the tablets do not match, place the second one to the right of the stack. Continue through the stack until a match is found, checking the control between comparisons.  Return the discards to the stack when a match is found.</li>

<p><strong>Materials:</strong>  basket, 2 drawstring bags of different colors each containing several objects; objects in each bag are identical; mat or rug</p>
<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The teacher and the child gather the bags and a rug and sit down together.</li>
<li>The teacher pulls out all of the shapes from her bag.  The child pulls out all the shapes from her bag.</li>
<li>They look at the shapes and match them together.</li>
<li>Each takes back their shapes.</li>

<ol>
<li>These lessons are best done in a group</li>
<li>These lessons are effective in teaching them new foods</li>
<li>These lessons can easily be tied to Culture activities</li>
<li>There are Tasting bottles however, these are not common in classrooms due to hygiene issues</li>
<li>These lessons can be fun and prompt lots of discussions related to science, the nutrition, the systems of the human body</li>
<li>These lessons can include drink and solid foods</li>
<li>These lessons are often linked to Practical Life: food preparation as individual works or as a community.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can dilute almond extract, lemon extract, vanilla extract, fresh-squeezed lemon, fresh-squeezed orange, to place in the bottles.  You can add the visual pictures for the students to place the bottle on.  Can have each child have their own dixie cup; dilute three drops of solution in water….squeeze the drop into the cup….</p>

<h3 id="sense-of-wonder">SENSE OF WONDER</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The world is truly a wonderful place.  There are endless discoveries, endless challenges. We share with each other the beauty, the delicacy and the variety in the world around us. We keep rediscovering the joy of living that is in us and all around us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One day in class we were studying prisms.  We watched the rainbows that were reflected from the window in the front of our school. As we watched, the children sat silently and respectfully as if they were in a church.  They watched for a long time at the beauty of this rainbow. It reminded me again of how I see but don&rsquo;t see every day, and of the privilege to be around children who find wonder in the most ordinary and in the spectacular.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, my responsibility to me is to make myself enormous, full of knowledge, full of love, full of understanding, full of experience, full of everything so that I can give it to you and then you can take it and build from there. &hellip; and once I&rsquo;ve given it to you, I will not have lost anything- I will still know everything I know. So, it isn&rsquo;t a matter of giving it away, it&rsquo;s a matter of sharing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reflect and write a lesson for an activity that promotes the children’s “exploration and discovery of their sense of wonder through observation, comparison, reasoning and problem solving to better appreciate and participate in the world.</p>
<p>Share your lessons with you peers and all will benefit!</p>
<p><strong>Ideas:</strong> nature walk, bird listening,</p>

<p><strong>Sense of Wonder</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The natural world around us is truly beautiful. It humbles us and encourages a sense of awe when encountering it’s wonder and beauty. This is one of the most universally documented effects of nature on human development.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To have the children experience this feeling inside of the classroom I chose to grow Narcissus bulbs in December.  Each child had a bulb and received an individual lesson on the bulb, planting and the gift it was going to share.  The bulbs were at first all together in a large shallow bowl on a small table in the center of our room.  This table stayed there for almost the entire month of December.  The wonder that the children felt was rooted in two of their senses, particularly their smell and sight.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each day as the children came in they checked their plant to see if a bud was forming and if the flower would be coming soon.  This went on for almost three weeks. Finally, one Monday morning, several of the flowers had opened over the weekend. The students were truly amazed that a bulb could root so fast and that a flower could emit so much scent!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the past I have always collected Swallow tail Butterfly caterpillars and let them eat and spin their cocoon in my classroom. It takes about 6-9 days for it to come out of its cocoon and I now know the telltale signs (the cocoon gets very black just before they emerge). So when I see the cocoon &ldquo;dancing&rdquo; and it is black, I call circle and we watch it emerge. It crawls all over the children in the first hour since its wings are not yet dry. The children find this so gentle and kind of the butterfly. There are few words to explain the awe of the children.</p>

<img class="float-right" src="http://example.org/img/sensorial/image192.webp" alt="Plants in Bottles">

<p><strong>Materials:</strong> one narcissus bulb (per child); one wide mouth Mason jar, small pebbles; one label
with child&rsquo;s name attached to jar with a ribbon (this could be a work in the Practical Life Area- ie: name tag work)</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>  none needed</p>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong> force a narcissus bulb</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Aims:</strong> Through exploration and discovery, the child develops and refines the ability to observe, compare, differentiate, reason, decide, solve problems, appreciate and participate in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 3+ </p>
<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>
<p>Preparation: About a week before bringing the bulb into the classroom; keep bulb at room temperature in water and rocks out of the classroom. This begins the process before the children see it so it will bloom in about two weeks later.  I usually get the bulbs underway over Thanksgiving and bring them into my classroom at the end of the following week.  I have a large bowl with all the bulbs in it in rocks and water. We use these bulbs in our Holiday celebration and each child gives it to his/her parents and takes them home to keep and plant.</p>
<ol>
<li>Invite a child to choose a bulb that only has green shoots at this point.</li>
<li>Show the child that she will place her bulb in her own jar and surround it in rocks</li>
<li>Add water to just touch the roots already well underway.</li>
<li>Tell the child that every morning she needs to check her bulb and add water if it needs it.</li>
<li>Show the child the tag making work in the Practical life area. Make a name tag and attach it with a ribbon to the jar.</li>
<li>Watch, anticipate, hope, observe, smile and smell.</li>
<li>Ask the child to reflect on joyful she will feel when she shares it with another person. Explain that this is the joy of giving.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Points of Interest:</strong>  Anticipation and the actual flower</p>
<p><strong>Control of Error:</strong>  Adequate water</p>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use amaryllis bulb;</li>
<li>Connect with Botany and plant study of life cycle</li>
<li>Show in spring how other bulbs are blooming</li>
<li>Encourage parents to plant at home in garden with a label</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extensions:</strong> math activities with measurement and estimation</p>
<p><strong>Vocabulary:</strong>  Narcissus bulb&rdquo;; &ldquo;the joy of giving</p>

<h3 id="sense-of-wonder-original-lesson-plan">Sense of Wonder Original Lesson Plan:</h3>
<p><strong>Materials:</strong> Binoculars (one for each child), Bird Boxes, Appropriate outdoor clothing, outdoor trail, preferably near nature, field guides for foliage and animal life in the habitat, cameras</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>  Grace and Courtesy lessons (particularly the silence lessons); discussions regarding wildlife and  habitats, particularly the habitat in the community of the classroom</p>
<p><strong>Direct Aim:</strong> Observe (and document) animals and plants in nature</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Aims:</strong> Through exploration and discovery, the child develops and refines the ability to observe, compare, differentiate, reason, decide, solve problems, appreciate and participate in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 3+ </p>
<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Invite the children to explore nature with you….explain that many wild animals will hide if they know people are near, so the children should strive to be as quiet as possible</li>
<li>Walk along a nature path (or observe squirrels and birds on the playground) as quietly as possible</li>
<li>Whisper for the children to close their eyes and listen for sounds of nature all around them</li>
<li>Draw the children’s attention to the wildlife they might have disregarded, such as birds and insects</li>
<li>Return to the classroom and invite children to share what they observed on the nature hike</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Points of Interest:</strong>  Animals and plants in nature, being able to go for a walk (and possibly leave the school grounds)</p>
<p><strong>Control of Error:</strong>  animals will be scared away if the children are not quiet enough</p>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explore different nature paths</li>
<li>Create booklets filled with pictures of the animals and plant life children should look for</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extensions:</strong> Teach children how to record their observations in a notebook, give each child a camera with which they can take a picture (which they can later put in a book they create)</p>
<p><strong>Vocabulary:</strong>  hike, photography/photographer, North, South, East, and West, compass, names of plants and animals in the field guide as well as what they see/observe</p>
