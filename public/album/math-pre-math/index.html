<h1 id="pre-math-math-activities-before-1-10">Pre-Math Math Activities (before 1-10)</h1>

<img class="float-left preview-md" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image001.webp" alt="Empty Shelf">

<p><strong>The Pre-Math/Early Math Exercise shelf</strong> in the math area is placed after the Sensorial exercises, but before the red and blue rods. The activities do not typically emphasize numbers but do allow practice of foundational mathematical ideas.  Activities may be selected and rotated to meet the needs of students in the classroom community. Teachers may also consider activities that scaffold the early Montessori lessons. This shelf also offers a place for number books and other children’s books related to math or small group math games.</p>
<h2 id="logical-quantification">Logical Quantification</h2>
<p>Source for Logical Quantification Section: Teresa Van Acker, CMTE/NC 1995</p>
<p>There are many math activities a child can engage in before the first traditional Montessori math materials beginning with the number rods. Logical Quantification is an important part of pre-math skills and understandings. The numbers 1-5 are perceptual numbers; we can see them in our minds without counting. To quantify is to determine or express a quantity. What is quantitative is expressed or expressible as a quantity; it is not numerical. At this state of instruction, there is no counting. In activities for logical quantification, the teacher uses language such as “this many,” “that many,” “set” and “group.” The following activities give the child the opportunity to see, feel, and carry different quantities.</p>
<p><strong>A basket of loose quantity on Math shelf 1</strong></p>

<img class="float-left preview-md" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image003.webp" alt="Beads">

<p>It is very useful to the guide and engaging for the student to have a basket of loose quantity. There should be at least 30 or so and they should be all the same. Some of the activities below can be done with these gems.
From an assessment point of view, it is very handy to have these for checking 1:1 correspondence, subitizing and even visual patterns. A young child can:</p>
<ul>
<li>make a vertical line  (a column) on the right hand edge of the rug- indirect preparation for operations</li>
<li>They can make rows and columns- an array</li>
<li>They can make patterns with the gems; pairs, triplets of gems</li>
<li>We can introduce more than/ less than (take 90% and give the child 10% and see what happens!)</li>
<li>And many more games..</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Building Sets</strong></p>

<img class="float-right preview-md" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image005.webp" alt="Building Sets">

<p>(1-5 perceptual numbers) Example: From a basket of shapes, the teacher takes out five and puts them in a ring of yarn and asks the child to do the same: “Make a set, or group of shapes.”</p>
<div class="spacer-div"></div>
<p><strong>One-to-One Matching or Quantity Gathering</strong></p>
<p>(1-5 perceptual numbers) Example: The teacher puts three blue eggs on her mat and asks the child to do the same: “Would you put on this paper that many blue eggs?” In another game, the teacher can give some First Period information to the child, for example: The teacher puts three cherries on her mat and says: “I have some cherries on my mat. Would you like to get that many cherries?”</p>
<p><strong>Shopping Bag Game</strong></p>
<p>(1-5 perceptual numbers) Example: The teacher takes out four shapes from the shopping bag and puts them on her mat and asks the child to do the same: “Get me that many things.”</p>
<p><strong>Shape Sort Presentation</strong></p>

<img class="float-right preview-md" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image007.webp" alt="Building Sets">

<p><strong>Materials:</strong> Box of shapes in a basket and tied strings of yarn.</p>
<ol>
<li>“Let’s sort by color.” “Let’s put all the red ones in here.” Arrange a tied string in a circle and place all the red shapes in the (red) circle.</li>
</ol>

<img class="preview-md" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image009.webp" alt="Building Sets">


<img class="float-right preview-md" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image009.webp" alt="Building Sets">

<ol start="2">
<li>“Let’s sort by shape ( or size).” “Let’s put all the squares (large) in here” Arrange another tied string in a circle next to the set of red shapes. Place all the squares inside that circle.  “But, wait! Some of the red ones are also squares.” “What do we do?”</li>
</ol>
<div class="spacer-div"></div>

<img class="float-right preview-md" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image012.webp" alt="Building Sets">

<ol start="3">
<li>“We could overlap the string like this.”  Arrange the strings to look like a Venn diagram. Place the red squares in the intersection area.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some other activities that are suitable for this early math shelf. There are many resources available for similar early math activities. Each possibility should be carefully evaluated for isolating the targeted outcome.</p>
<h2 id="building-sets-using-multiple-attributes">Building Sets using Multiple Attributes</h2>
<p>The sensorial exercises draw a child’s attention to attributes: such as length, height, width, texture, weight, taste, and shape. Objects that isolate these types of attributes can be supplied.</p>
<p><strong>“What’s my rule?” activity</strong><br>
This activity helps a child /small group of children practice seeing common attributes among objects that are not identical. The teacher provides a basket/tray of objects that are similar and have the potential of identical attributes. (Example: large buttons in a variety of shapes and colors – some with two holes and some with four holes OR fan shaped shells and conch shaped shells with some in both groups having dots.) Cut a long narrow strip of felt as a mat.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lead a discussion about the objects. “What do you notice about these objects?” Encourage the children to notice size, shape, color, texture etc.</li>
<li>Determine ONE target characteristic and select five objects that meet that criteria and lay the objects in a row on the mat.</li>
<li>Tell the children, “This is the set I want you to look at.” “What is the rule to belong to this set?”</li>
<li>Children may notice, “It must be a red button.” “It must be a star shaped button.” “It must be a small button.”</li>
<li>Then, on a different day, offer a set with two common attributes, “It must be a red button and have four holes.” “It must be a dotted shell that is bumpy.”</li>
<li>On a different day, offer a set of SIX objects and ask the children, “Which object DOES NOT belong in this set?”</li>
<li>On a different day, invite each child to build a set using a rule.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="subitizing">Subitizing</h2>
<p>A child subitizes when she makes an immediate and accurate determination of a quantity of items without needing to count them. Children can usually subitize up to a quantity of five, adults to a quantity of six. This is a skill that can be practiced. Children learn to “trust the count” and do not need to start from one each time to count the quantity. Subitizing activities can start with cards displaying dots arranged in predictable patterns (like dots on the face of dice) and then move on to dots of a similar quantity arranged in a variety of ways. After that, quantities of loose objects can be manipulated in a similar way.</p>
<p><strong>“Show me what you saw?” game</strong><br>
Gather a beautiful scarf, a basket of identical objects such as flattened glass marbles, plastic discs, poker chips or other manipulatives, four small bowls and five small felt mats. The scarf may be replaced with a silk fan, a lid with a knob to hold, or some other item that can hide the objects on the teacher’s mat.</p>
<ol>
<li>Distribute a small felt mat and small bowl containing five objects to each child in the group.</li>
<li>Place one felt mat in 	the center of the group – this is the teacher’s mat to manage.</li>
<li>The teacher covers the empty mat with the scarf and then asks the children to close their eyes/put on a blindfold.</li>
<li>The teacher secretly gathers a quantity of objects to place on the mat under the scarf. The number of objects should always be under five.</li>
<li>Invite the children to open their eyes and look at the mat in the center. Pull back the scarf to reveal the mat for a few seconds and then cover the mat again.</li>
<li>“Now show me what you saw.” “Make your mat look just like mine.”</li>
<li>When the children are finished arranging objects on their mats, reveal the center mat 	again. Allow the children to inspect it and compare it to their own mats. Invite them to make changes if needed.</li>
<li>After experience, the teacher may invite the children to take turns placing objects on the teacher’s mat.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>“Draw what you saw!” game</strong><br>
This game is played just as the “Show me what you saw!” game but instead of mats and objects, 	the students are provided small dry erase boards or paddles, dry erase markers, and a small 	piece of flannel to use as an eraser. The children are asked to draw small circles for each object they see on the mat. They are also encouraged to draw the objects in the same arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>“High Card Takes It!” game</strong><br>
Create a set of 20 cards with dots arranged on one side as seen on the face of a dice – 1,2,3,4,5. 	There should be four of each quantity card. Shuffle the cards and share them out between two children. (This game is played like the traditional card game “War.”) This game uses the idea of 	greater than and less than. A deck of cards with the face cards removed is also an option.</p>

<img class="preview-md" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image016.webp" alt="Playing Cards Game">


<img class="preview-md" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image014.webp" alt="Dice Game">

<h2 id="patterning">Patterning</h2>
<p>Using sets of objects, build patterns (ABABAB, ABBABBABB, ABCABC, AABAABAAB, etc.) and ask the child to copy the pattern, complete the pattern, fill in a missing piece of the pattern, continue the pattern, and finally, to create his own pattern.</p>
<p>Pattern cards may be supplied to guide the child. A tray containing sets of objects should also be provided to the child. Objects may be from nature (stones, seed pods, sticks, pine cones, shells) or represent everyday objects of interest (coins, buttons, and hardware fasteners). Avoid toys or other unrealistic or distracting objects.</p>

<h2 id="graphing">Graphing</h2>

<img class="float-left preview-md" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image022.webp" alt="Subitizing Bar Graph">

<p><strong>Subitizing Bar Graph</strong><br>
The child tosses the dice, finds the corresponding quantity after
subitizing or counting and enters a mark (“X”) above that quantity.
Young children may choose to make a circle, color in the square, or
make some other sort of tally mark.</p>
<div class="spacer-div"></div>
<div class="col-2">
	


<img class="pure-img" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image023.webp" >


<div class="">
	<strong>The Die Game (1-6)</strong><br>
The child tosses the die, counts or subitizes the dots, and then enters a mark, ( usually an “X”) or colors in the square on the tally sheet. Counting, subitizing, number recognition, and graphing all come into play during this work. Bingo dotter can be used, too. First number to the top wins.
</div>


<img class="pure-img" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image028.webp" >


<div class="">
	<strong>The Die Game (2-12)</strong><br>
Same approach as the Die Game (1-6) but two (dice) are used. This introduces the idea of addition. Also, the game supports the practice of subitizing the larger quantity and then “counting on” to get to the total quantity. Note: the score card starts with the number 2, not 1!
</div>


</div>
<p>Children may also choose to create customized graphs. Choices can be drawn into the lowest squares of the columns. Then, children may survey children in the classroom (favorite color, animal, ice cream flavor etc.) Guidelines must be established so working children are not interrupted.</p>
<div class="spacer-div"></div>
<h2 id="parts-and-wholes">Parts and Wholes</h2>
<p>The Montessori Fraction Skittles could also be part of this shelf as the idea of whole, one-half, one-third, and one-fourth were most likely introduced during food preparation activity in the practical life area.</p>
<h2 id="equivalencies-exchange-games">Equivalencies (Exchange Games)</h2>
<p>These games are played by two children. Lessons on rolling the dice to determine who goes first, and how to take turns may need to be offered to the children. 10 frame and 5 frame mats eliminate the requirement of accurate counting.</p>
<div class="col-2">
	


<img class="pure-img" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image031.webp" >


<div class="">
	<strong>Exchange Game (with Golden Beads)</strong><br>
Two children play this game. Each child rolls the dice and then collects unit beads. When ten unit beads are collected, the child may exchange for a ten bar. When ten 10 bars are collected, the child exchanges for a hundred square. This is a popular game! Assess counting, subitizing, decimal system, composing quantities, naming quantities. Consider using a felt mat with a 10 frame drawn on it with a permanent marker.
</div>


<img class="pure-img" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image034.webp" >


<div class="">
	<strong>Exchange Game (with money)</strong><br>
This game is played like the Golden Bead Exchange Game but the penny serves as a unit, the dime serves and the ten bar, and the dollar serves as the 100 square. Introduce money vocabulary. Base ten.
Consider providing 10-frame felt mats for the pennies and dimes.
</div>


<img class="pure-img" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image037.webp" >


<div class="">
	<strong>Exchange Game (with money)</strong><br>
This game is similar to the base 10 money game above. This is not base 10, so focus is more about money. Collect 5 nickels and exchange for a quarter, collect two quarters for a half dollar (and collect two half dollars for a dollar if dollars are added to tray). Introduces money vocabulary, the idea of half, and the equivalent quantities between these particular coins.

            <h4>Two separate 1-10 number paths.</h4>
        </figcaption>

<p>The 1-10 number path may be used in a similar way to the two exercises described below.</p>
<div class="clear-float"></div>
<p><div class="spacer-div"></div> <div class="spacer-div"></div></p>

<img class="float-left" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image040.webp" alt="Number Path Game Board">

<p>Different colored tokens can be placed on the “1” of each number path. Use two dice; one to indicate the color token that will move, and the other to indicate how many spaces the token will move. Several children may play. All children work together to move all the tokens to the end of the path. Children DO NOT choose a color token to call, “mine.”
Use several number paths to create a game board.</p>
<div class="clear-float"></div>

<img class="preview-md" src="http://example.org/img/math/pre-math/image041.webp" alt="Children Working with Number Paths">

<p>Here is a number path with flaps over the numbers. The teacher reveals a number and asks what number will appear under a nearby flap. The child identifies the number, then checks under the flap.</p>
