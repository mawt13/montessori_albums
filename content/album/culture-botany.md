## Sheer Beauty and Wonder!


### Introduction to Botany

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/botany/image004.webp" alt="Flower Closeup" >}}

The Botany curriculum offers a wide range of opportunities to pursue personal interests, engage with community offerings and integrate topics throughout the other areas of the classroom. The presentations in Botany curriculum follow a standard flow for all topics which is outlined below. Studying Botany also offers an excellent opportunity to develop the spiritual nature of the child. When we study plants, there are numerous moments to experience wonder and awe. Both are foundational sources for the development of the human spirit, no matter what age.


The lessons in the Botany curriculum call follow the same general sequence:

{{< pure_table 
"Topic|Notes"
"General theme|For example, the leaf; done outside whenever possible"
"Types and parts with diverse real specimens from nature|Done outside whenever possible"
"Extensions and experiments related to the specimens for the topic|Integrated into other areas of the classroom such as Practical Life, Art, Language etc."
"The puzzle related to the topic: second naming of the “parts of” and presentation of the function of that part is explained at this second naming of the parts.|Because the puzzles are not challenging for 4 to 6-year-olds, they need to have already engaged through their senses with the specimens and the experiments to have had plenty of foundational experiences prior to doing the puzzle. Otherwise, the puzzle itself is typically not very stimulating."
"Card work and Booklet Material|This offers the opportunity to the child to master the topic and to make their own booklets that identify the parts with the name (colored red) and often a short definition involving the function or another characteristic feature of that part."
"Finally, all throughout study of the topic, we integrate the topic into other areas of the classroom including Language, Art, Sensorial, Practical life and even Math."
>}}

The flexibility and creativity in the Culture area allows for adult and child exploration, the development of personal interests and finally, learning through an integrated curriculum. For example, if we are sprouting lentils, this is a perfect opportunity to reinforce calendar work by keeping track of how many days it takes for the sprouts to germinate. Perhaps, we could also use this time to introduce the math practice of using tally marks as an early method of data management. How many tallies in total? This same sprouting activity can become a Practical Life food preparation work when serving the sprouts (with ranch dressing if needed) at snack.  The possibilities are endless and exciting.

By examining with a magnifying glass, a pinecone, a sunflower head or a petal from a lily a child practices concentration and builds the habit of work engagement.  However, it’s very probable this work also touches their spirit as they encounter the beauty and intricacy of nature. All opportunities during the study of nature, including land, water, biomes as well as plants and animals promote humility and reverence for the complexity and diversity of life on earth. Most humans, both children and adults feel a substantial sense of awe when confronted with pure nature. In her work entitled, Nurturing the Spirit in non-sectarian classrooms, Aline Wolf defines spirituality at the end of her second chapter dedicated to that same topic as:

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/botany/image006.webp" alt="Person Outline with energy" >}}


> Spirituality implies a sacred connection with all of life and a oneness with the universe. This means that every act of carelessness, selfishness, indifference, hatred or violence toward nature or other human beings is actually against ourselves, our families and our culture. Therefore, spirituality summons us the highest of human virtues, such as love, caring, generosity and responsibility for our actions, forgiveness, compassion and openness to one another. It leads us to sharing rather than accumulating, to cooperation rather than competition and to peace rather than violence (Wolf, 1996 pp.10-11).

Cultivating respect for the natural world and for each other is an integral part of the Culture curriculum of which Botany is a wonderfully supportive element.

### ANIMAL, PLANT & OTHER  (& Review of living and non-living){.redc}

**Materials:**
- Real plant, classroom pet or another live animal and fungus, mold and/or mushrooms
- Objects that are reproductions of real, identifiable plants and animals
- Blank paper and marker/ pencil for writing labels of “living“\
Pre-made labels for “plant” and “animal”  and “other” or black paper

**Prerequisites:** 
- What is a Model?
- Classification works

**Direct Aim:**
- To show three categories of living things  
- To identify characteristics of a plants
- To connect the student to the indoor and outdoor environments.

**Indirect Aims:** (Practical) 
- To prepare the student for further botany and classification lessons
- To instill respect of and care for the natural environment 
- To connect the student with works that involve plants

**Age:** 3-5

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**
* Sensorial Level:
* Naming/Concept Level:
* Higher Order Thinking Level:

**Presentation:**  ANIMAL, PLANT & OTHER
1.  Invite the child being sure to name the work.
2.  Bring the plant, animal and mushrooms to the rug.
3.  Place them in the center of the rug. 
4.  Invite the children to look and talk about the plant, animal  and mushroom before them. 
5. Review of living & non-living: Ask a child to go and retrieve the label cards from the living and non-living work. Or, you can have the cards there at the lesson but out of sight for the initial observation part of the lesson or have available blank paper for writing labels, “living, non-living”. 
6. Ask the child if we can place the card “non-living” by the plant. If they say “yes,” ask them if we can talk about how we know something is living or non-living. Review living and non-living if needed. 

⇒ Resource from National Park Service on Living and non-living\

{{< pure_table
"Non-living|Living"
"does not change|grows"
"does not reproduce|reproduces"
"does not eat|eats"
"does not breathe|breathes"
"does not need water|needs water"
"does not move|moves"
"does not adapt or respond to the environment|adapts or responds to the environment"
>}}

7. Repeat for the animal: “Can we place the non-living card next to the (pet) X?” Optional: At this point, you may want to invite the child(ren) to hold and examine the living object (plant and animal) in their own hands if possible. 

8. Tell the children, with enthusiasm and surprise that we need another “living” label! Write a second label “living” and place it next to or under the animal.

9. Repeat for the mushrooms: “Can we place the non-living card next to the mushrooms?” Optional: At this point, you may want to invite the child(ren) to hold and examine the living object in their own hands if possible. Mold needs to be in a closed container. 

10. Tell the children, with enthusiasm and surprise that we need another “living” label! Write a second label “living” and place it next to or under the mushrooms.

11. Tell the children, “Now that we know that all are that same in the way that they are all living” ask, “how can we describe their differences?” Engage in a conversation with the children; refer to the chart below to guide your discussion.

{{< pure_table 
"Plants|Animals|Other"
"are rooted in the ground and do not move on their own (except for growing)|most animals have the ability to move about freely|do not have roots; cannot move"
"make their own food called chlorophyll from sunlight|Are dependent on plants and other animals for food|do not make their own food; eat living or dead plant and/ or  animal matter"
"take in (“breathe in”) carbon dioxide and give off oxygen|breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide|breathe oxygen and release carbon dioxide"
"have cells that have walls (allow the plant to stand up)|have cells that do not have walls (muscles and bones allow an animal to stand up, swim, fly etc.)|Have cell walls though they are different from plants. Plant cell walls have cellulose while fungi chitin"
"very basic ability to sense|very developed ability to sense and have a nervous system|Can sense environmental signs and react accordingly"
>}}

12.  Ask the children for other examples of animals. They may give one, for example, a cat. Ask them for more information about each other categories in the above chart. Can a cat make its own food? What does a cat eat?  Does a cat have a skeleton and muscles to move?  Can a cat use its sense of hearing, sight, smell etc.?  

13. Ask the children for other examples of plants. They may give one, for example, a maple tree. Ask them for more information about each other categories in the above chart. Can a maple tree make its own food? What does a maple tree eat?  Does a maple tree have a skeleton and muscles to move?  Can a maple tree use its sense of hearing, sight, smell etc.?

14. Ask the children for other examples of fungi. They may give one, for example, a mushroom. Ask them for more information about each other categories in the above chart. Can a mushroom make its own food? What does a mushroom eat?  Does a mushroom have a skeleton and muscles to move?  Does a mushroom have senses  to hear, see, smell?

15. Invite the children to think of a work in the classroom that is related to plants and animals and to do that work now thinking about their differences or, to do one of the extensions listed below.

**Points of Interest:**
- Connecting to previous lessons (living and non-living)
- Needing three “living” labels for the animal, plant and fungi
- The differences between plants, animal and other (especially the plant that makes its own food)
- Holding the plant, fungi or animal (if possible)

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher
- The familiarity of the items 

**Variations:**
- Do the lesson outside, interacting with the environment
- Invite the children to bring in plant or animal

**Extensions:**
- Make a booklet with animals and plants showing what they eat, breathe, how they move etc.
- 	Do a drawing lesson on how to draw an animal,  plant  mushrooms using the geometric solids and /or metal insets and their names. For example, to draw a cat, bring the ellipsoid and the ellipse frame to the rug to show how to make the body. Bring the rectangular prism and the rectangle frame to the rug to draw the legs. 
-  Make a scavenger hunt outside to discover many plants, animals and fungi (or their homes [bird houses, nests] trees, plants, shrubs, logs, old food)

**Vocabulary:**\
Plant, animal, fungi, mushroom, chlorophyll, oxygen, carbon dioxide, breathe in, exhale, reproduce, adapt

### PLANT CARE: YEARLY/ SEASONAL ACTIVITIES AND CYCLES{.redc}

The Prepared Environment is much improved by the presence of living plants. The children can be taught how to care for the plants all year long including mulching them since they are indoors and need more minerals and nutrients than just water. Over-watering is usually avoided by a clear, lesson-based system that marks a plant as “already watered.” However, the oversight of the guide is necessary. Many schools and/or guides ask the children to bring in an indoor plant to help decorate the environment and then the child monitors and cares for the plant year-round. Most families need coaching as to what types of indoor plants and the size needed so that they will thrive in the actual classroom space given its light, temperature and children’s touch. Live plants contribute to good air flow, positive energy and beauty of the learning space.

Guides typically design activities around the Botany curriculum that incorporate the outdoors, including giving lessons outdoors, bringing the outdoors inside and field trips to botanical gardens, vegetable and herb farms, farmer markets and local merchants such as florists, garden stores and/or organic markets. The study of Botany is a great place to ground the spiritual development of the human person. By studying plant life cycles with their eternal and unstoppable bursting forth of new life fosters awe and reverence for life, our earth as well as for our own development on this earth. The wonder the children experience through their senses of sprouting lentils, growing seedlings, multicolored leaves and even of the power of the sun develops their inner spirit which responds joyfully to harmony, beauty and goodness. Studies of nature, particularly plants which are so accessible to them can be connected to lessons on the spiritual development of the human person, such as The Love Light lesson from Honoring the Light of the Child: Activities to Nurture Living Skills in Young Children by Sonnie McFarland.

## The Seed

{{< box class="w-400 center-block" >}}
{{< img class="white-outline pure-img" src="/img/culture/botany/image008.webp" alt="Various Seeds in Special Flower Bowels" >}}
{{< /box >}}


### SEEDS: TYPES AND FACTS{.redc}

**Materials:**
- Various types of seeds: sunflower, pumpkin, apple, orange, chia, peach, beans etc. It is helpful to have a mixture of easily edible and non-edible for both interest and sensory engagement
- Labels or blank paper for writing 
- A few whole fruits and/or vegetables to cut open in front of the children; such as an apple, orange, green bean, banana, squash, tomato etc.
- Basket for whole fruits and vegetables with cutting board, knife and cloth napkin to cover it.

**Prerequisites:**
- Plant and animal
- Living and non-living 
- Other sorting and/or classification works

**Direct Aims:**
- build awareness for the variety of seeds
- understand that seeds are the beginning of life and will always produce the same kind of plant
- foster care for plants, nature and the earth in general

**Indirect Aim:**
- Prepare for other Botany lessons on trees, leaves etc. 
- Prepare for Botany cabinet lessons 
- Prepare for flower and fruit lessons 
- Prepare for Parts of the seed lesson

**Age:** 3 - 6

**Presentation:** Seed types and facts
1. Invite the children to the presentation sharing that there may even be some tasting involved! This, like other early Botany (and Zoology lessons) are best done in small, multi-age groups so the elders can model responses and ask further questions.

2. Bring the assortment of seeds and the to the rug.  Spread the seeds out on the rug to one side (one half of the rug). Bring the covered basket whole samples of fruits and vegetables with knife, cutting board but keep the basket covered and away or behind. Tell the children we are going to examine, learn about and taste some of these seeds. 

3. Begin by naming the entire category (seeds) defining the seed: a (flowering plant's) unit of reproduction, capable of developing into another such plant. Or, a seed is an embryo of a new plant. Remind them that reproducing is one of the characteristics of a living thing and a seed is from a living plant. You can explain that seeds are alive but are in a dormant (sleeping stage) until they are put in water or soil, then they begin to grow and are fully alive.
4. Write labels for “fruit” and “vegetable”. Ask the children to verbally give some examples of fruits. Then ask the same for examples of vegetables. Place the label “fruit” in the upper empty part of the rug. Then, write the word “vegetable” and place it next to the previous label so as to create two columns.

5. Pull out the basket that has the whole fruits and vegetables, cutting board and knife. Remove one fruit, such as the apple and the knife and cutting board. Say, this is an apple, a fruit of an apple tree. Cut the apple in half, letting each side lay with the skin side down on the cutting board. Using the knife tip or your fingers, remove the apple seeds carefully without damaging them. 

6. Pass the seeds around. Feel that they are moist. Ask the students to describe them. Ask the students if they are edible. Then, cut the apple up into pieces and share the apple with the students at the lesson. Place the apple seeds underneath the label that says “fruit.” Taken another item out of the basket, a green bean perhaps. Slice the green bean along the edge lengthwise opening the bean carefully and slowly to see the bean seeds inside. Show the opened green bean to all.

7. Invite the students to remove the bean seeds. As above, ask the students to describe them. Then, ask them if they are edible. Invite the students to the bean seeds but save one or two to place under the label “vegetable.” 

8. Do a three-period lesson about the two samples of beans seen thus far. Take out another fruit or vegetable and again cut it open carefully to show the seeds. Remind the students that the seed is the “baby” (embryo) that will grow into the same plant when in soil or water. 

9. Share out the fruits or vegetables if they are edible in a raw state. Move the basket, knife, cutting board away from the rug area. Keep the banana for later. 

10. Begin to examine the seeds that have been laid out on the rug to one side. Play guessing games to determine if it is a seed of a vegetable or fruit. Distribute the seeds with the children’s help into the correct columns.

11. Examine and discuss the sizes, textures, colors of the various seeds. Tell the children that now you are going to show them a fruit with VERY tiny seeds that we eat without even knowing. Take out the basket with knife, cutting board and the banana. Open the banana and then cut the banana into slices. Give each one a piece and ask them to examine the center of the banana. Show them that the tiny dots are the seeds and that we eat them with the fruit!

12. Do a recapitulation of facts learned in this presentation:

- Some seeds are edible
- Some seeds are consumed with the fruit (bananas, strawberries, blueberries etc.) 
- Seeds are the “baby” of the new plant
- Seeds are dormant until in water or soil
- Seeds come in many shapes, sizes, colors and textures

13. Thank the children for coming to the lesson. Offer a seed-based work on the Botany, Art or Practical life shelf.

### EXPERIMENTS WITH SEEDS: Sprouting{.redc}

**Materials:**\
**Presentation 1:**
- 3-5 Tablespoons of loose organic edible seeds (from legume plants or grain plants) such as lentils, wheatgrass, garbanzos, clover, soybeans (pre-soaked for about 8 hrs.; check seed soaking requirements for sprouting)
- Pitcher for water
- Rinsed, clean 1-quart mason jar with ring screw top
- fresh water 
- paper towel and a fork or cheese cloth cut to a 5x5 in. square 
- small glass bowl
- magnifying glass on a tray

**Presentation 2:**
- 1 lime bean per student (pre-soaked for 24 hrs.)
- Plastic bags (snack size) OR clear cup or glass for each student
- Cotton balls or circle pads  (about 5 per student)
- A sharpie pen
- Large glass bowl and a pitcher of water
- Sunny window
 
**Prerequisites:** 
- Living and non-living 
- Seeds: Types and Facts

**Direct Aims:**
- demonstrate the seed’s ability to go from dormant state to sprouting phase
- see the development of a seed, to a sprout and into a plant
- foster a sense of wonder and awe
- teach the scientific skill of observation and recording

**Indirect Aim:**  
- Prepare for other Botany lessons on trees, leaves etc. 
- Prepare for Botany cabinet lessons 
- Prepare for flower and fruit lessons 
- Prepare for Parts of the seed lesson
- Foster care and respect for the natural world

**Age:** 3 - 6

**Presentation I:** Sprouting many seeds
1. This is best done as a group activity in front of the children or as an afternoon group activity with the 3rd years/elders of the classroom. Children can participate, and the lesson below includes these moments. Bring the supplies needed for the first presentation 1 to the group. 
2. Take out the seeds and spread them on the rug. You can count them, describe them, name them etc. Have the children pick out any that are deformed, halved or do not look like the others. Have the some of the students put the seeds in the empty mason jar.  

3. Ask a child or two to take the pitcher and to go fill it with water. Have another child pour the water into the mason jar covering the seeds. 

4. Have a child place the paper towel or cheese cloth over the mason jar holding it down snugly. Have another child screw on the ring cap slowly over the paper towel securing it in place. If using a paper towel, take a fork and gently poke some holes in the paper towel. 

5. Place the jars on their sides if there are many seeds in the jar or else up the normal upright position. They do not need to be near the window, but they can be placed there. 

6. If the children know how to tell the hour on the clock, then together they can calculate about 8 hours from the current time. 

7.  Rinse the seeds twice a day in the following manner: remove the lid and paper towel. Fill the jar about half way with fresh clean water. Shake vigorously the jar making sure all the seeds are rinsed well. Placing your hand over the mouth of the mason jar, invert the jar and empty out the water. Do the same for all jars. 

8. This may be done once in the early morning with the children and then second time, near the close of the day, about 8 hours later. 

9. Tell the children that this can be a work, but it is one that we do not remove, we simply go to the jars and observe. Remind them of how to observe without touch. (Moving the jars will not hinder the sprouting process however, it does protect against from being dropped and breaking in which case the whole experiment would have to be thrown away!) 

10. Each day invite the children to do an observation work and check for change. At this point, it is helpful to connect this waiting period to calendar work and to mark the days of waiting. 
11. After about three days, the seeds or legumes will begin to sprout! Once they have begun to sprout, take one or two seeds out and place them in the glass bowl on the tray with the magnifying glass. Allow this to be a work on the shelf that they examine and draw or write about. IF the sample sprouting seeds are going to be out all day as a work, you will need to add 1-2 drops of water to keep them moist. Then, after a day or so, return the sprouting seeds to the mason jar with the others. 
12. Keep observing and recording either as a group and/or individually what they observe. This can be done on one large piece of paper near the jars. Each entry of a group observation should be entered either with the date. For example: 
	- Day 1: Observation: no change
	- Day 2:  Observation: no change
	- Day 3: Observation: no change
	- Day 4: Observation: small white shoots are emerging from one end of the round seed. They shoot is about half the size of the seed. It is slightly curved.
	- Day 5: Observation: the shoot begins to turn green at the top and lighter green where it is coming out of the seed. It is no longer straight. It is curling near the end that is away from the seed.

13. Keep rinsing twice daily even after they have begun to sprout. This is a gentle, slow and careful process. When the spouts are about 2 inches long, they are ready to remove and eat.

14. Bring the spouts to the rug with a group of children. Bring a pitcher of water and rinse the spouts one last time in front of the children. Empty the water out and discard it. Gently reach in the jar and pull out the mass of spouts. Place them on a plate or the mat and tell them children they are ready to eat. Tell the children that these are “baby” plants, are edible and are very nutritious. 

15. Divide the sprouts among the children and invite them to eat them. They can be eaten alone, or they can be eaten with some dressing. 

16. Do a recapitulation of facts learned in this experiment:
	- Seeds move from dormant to sprouts with time and water.
	- Many seeds are edible in the sprouting phase
	- The seeds need to be rinsed twice daily both before and after the sprouting starts
	- Sprouts are healthy to eat
	- Sprouts are baby plants and could be planted in soil to make a new plant instead of being eaten
	- The sprout changes in color, shape and size as it grows.
	- The seed coat can often be seen at the top of the sprout or can be left behind at the bottom of the jar. These are typically not eaten but they can be.
	- Science experiments include a specific process and steps, regular observation and recording what we see, hear, smell, taste and feel. 

17. Thank the children for coming to the lesson. 

**Presentation II:** single bean sprouting

1. Invite a group of children to a work table area where 3-5 children can be at a time. Thank them for coming to lesson. Bring all the materials to the work area.

2. Carefully take out the pre-soaked kidney beans and lay them out of the table or a table mat. 

3. Ask the children to delicately take one bean each and examine it. Talk about the facts they see:
	- The bean is delicate
	- The bean is fat and a little squishy
	- The bean may be beginning to lose its seed coat (outer casing)

4. Engage them in a conversation and explain to the children that they have been soaked for 24 hours. Tell them children that this is an individual seed, and each is going to spout their own seed.

5. Take out the individual small plastics bags and help the children if needed write their name with a sharpie pen on the baggie.

6. Place the large glass bowl in the center of the table so it is accessible to all the students at the table. Invite a child to pout the water into the bowl. Take out the cotton balls or circle pads and demonstrate gently and slowly dipping the cotton balls in the water. It is not necessary to submerge it. Show them how the cotton absorbs the water quickly and only needs to touch the surface. 

7. Open a small baggie and place the cotton ball in the baggie. Repeat four to five times until the bottom of the baggie is filled with a row of wet cotton balls or pads. 

8. Take one bean and place it in the baggie. Close and seal the baggie. Take the baggie with the cotton and seed to the window and tape it on the window pane.

9. Invite the children to recall the observation process done with mason jar of sprouts: wait, observe and record in pictures and/or words. 

10. Children can observe, record and plant their new bean plant in a cup or yogurt container with soil and water. 

**Points of Interest:**
- Their own seed to sprout
- The excitement of change
- The drawing and recording of observations 
- A work to take home

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher, other children

**Variations:**
- Change the type of seed (snow peas for example)

### PLANTS: TYPES AND PARTS OF PLANTS{.redc}

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/botany/image018.webp" caption="Arrowhead Vine" >}}

**Materials:**
- Large images of various types of plants: trees, shrubs, vines, vegetable, flowers, flowering trees etc. 
- Plant guide for the local area
- A live, healthy houseplant that can easily show roots, leaves and stems. Arrowhead vine, Philodendron work well for this lesson.
- Knife and large spoon
- Plastic mat 

**Prerequisites:** 
- Living/non-living
- Plant/animal

**Age:** 3 - 5

**Presentation 1:** Types of plants: ideally this lesson is done outdoors. 
1. Bring single pictures or books of various types of plants. Engage in conversation and discussion of types of plants: trees, shrubs, flowering plants, flowering trees, vegetables, houseplants etc.

2. Elicit other examples from their home or other known environments. 

3. Model recording the types and names of the trees, shrubs and plants. Model having a plant guide so as to look up a name of a plant.

4. If doing this lesson inside and only with images, write the names of the plants and place the written label next to or below the image.

5. Explain that some plants can only live indoors, and they are called houseplants. These are plants that are from the region of Earth where it is warm all the time; the Tropic zone at the equator. Recall the lesson on the Climate Zones.

6. Invite the children to do a drawing extension work following this lesson. They can draw what they see or they can draw from memory a plant that they know well. 

**Presentation 2:** Parts of plants
1. Bring a group of children to the table or work area
2. Begin by reviewing:
	- How we know the plant is alive
	- How we know the plant is a plant
	- How to do and make observations as scientists

3. Next, tell the children that we are going to look at the parts of the houseplant.

4. Place the potted plant in the center of the work area. Ask a child to show you the leaves of the plant. Point out several different leaves and compare them in color, size and texture. Show the children how to handle and touch the leaves gently.

5. Carefully pull the plant top all together to expose where the plant goes into the soil in the pot. Tell the children that these are the stems that hold the leaves and go into the soil.

6. Then, take one small section of the plant and, using a knife or spoon, gently cut away one stem from the root ball. You will need to gently saw or pry into the soil and get a section of a stem with leaves and some roots.

7. Gently tug on the stem so as to break it away form the other roots and extract it from the soil.

8. Lay the stem with leaves and roots with soil on a plastic mat. Remove the plant from the work area to focus only on the removed section.

9. Ask the children to name and label with you the parts of the plant. Write “leaves” and place it next to the leaves section, write “stem” and place it next to the stem and then write “roots” and place it next to the root section.

10. Examine the roots: help them use adjectives to describe or nouns to name them: such as, white, fine, thread-like, filaments, long, flexible, divided, delicate, fragile, hair, hair-like etc.

11. Initiate a discussion about the role of: (point and use the real plant during discussions)
	- Soil: provides nutrients to the plant.
	-  Roots: roots bring water and nutrients in the soil through the stems to the leaves. Roots allow water and nutrients to travel up the plant.
	- Stems: stems hold up the plant and the leaves, so they are exposed to light and air. Remind them that plants cells have cell walls and this feature enables plants to stand up.
	- Leaves: leaves produce the food for the plant because plants make their own food. The leaves take in the sunlight and use light to make food! This makes the leaves turn green. (Remind them that when the sprouts came out of the seed, they were white and then later turned green; this is when it started to make food to feed the growing plant that is emerging.)

12. Invite the children to do a plant work in the classroom such as, watering the classroom plants, removing dead leaves, dusting the leaves etc.

**Direct Aims:**
- -prepare for the parts of a tree and the tree puzzle
- prepare for lessons on the parts of the leaf and the leaf puzzle
- prepare for lessons on the parts of the roots and the root puzzle if available in the classroom. This is often and elementary work.

**Indirect Aim:**  
- Connect the child to care of the natural world
- Connect the child to care of the learning environment
- Spark wonder and awe for the power of nature and life

**Points of Interest:**
- A real plant
- The hidden roots
- The delicate nature of the roots

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher, other children

### EXPERIMENTS WITH PLANTS{.redc}

**Materials:**
* Pres: I
* Two identical small indoor plants (bean plants can be used as well)
* Dark closet
* Water pitcher
* Tablespoon
* Pres: II
* Small plant (that has been watered recently; whose soil is somewhat damp)
* Large zip lock bag

**Prerequisites:** 
* Plants: types and parts 
* Animal vs. plant 
* Papers/clipboard to mark days

**Age:** 3 - 5 

**Presentation I:** role of sunlight
1. Bring the two small plants to the rug. 

2. Tell the children that we are going to do an experiment to understand how plants live and grow.

3. Ask the children to compare the two plants. 

4. Ask a child to go and get water in the pitcher. 

5. Using the tablespoon, put exactly the same number of tablespoons of water in each plant.

6. Put one plant on the windowsill and the other in a cabinet that remains dark when closed. 

7. Tell the children that each day, one person is going to water the plant on the windowsill and one person is going to water the plant in the cabinet. After removing it to water it, put the plant immediately back in the dark closet.

8. Track each day for at least 5-7 days.

9. After a week, bring the two plants back to the rug and compare them again. Help the children use exact adjectives to describe the plant. Such as, the plant in the dark now has very light green, yellowish leaves that are drooping and limp. The leaves on the windowsill plant has bright green leaves, that are shiny, erect and healthy.

10. Engage the children in a conversation about why there are differences in the two plants.

11. Identify the sun as the reason that the windowsill plant is healthy.

12. Remind the children that the sun helps the plant make its own food and makes the leaves stay a bright green. If they are green, that means that they are taking in sunlight and making food.

**Presentation II:** leaf transpiration
1. Bring the plant and plastic bag to the rug

2. Engage the children in a conversation about how important leaves are to the plant.
	* They collect sunlight to make food (process of photosynthesis)
	* This food feeds the plant and supports humans because the leaves give off oxygen when they are making food for the plant.
	* The plant takes in carbon dioxide to make food and gives off oxygen: an exchange – we need plants and plants need us.
	* Leaves need water, nutrients and sun to make food
	* The roots bring up the water with nutrients; it travels to the leaves and is used to make food and it gives off the oxygen as it makes food.
	* The leaves release the extra water that doesn’t have any nutrients in it anymore, so they can bring more nutrient rich water to their leaves and keep making food.
	* The leaves get rid of the “used” water. The process of getting rid of the water is called: transpiration.

3. Ask the children if they have ever wiped sweat off their forehead.  Tell them plants “sweat” all the time, but it evaporates (goes into the air) so fast that we do not see it. 

4. Tell the children we are going to be able to see the water coming off the leaves with an experiment.

5. Place the plant in the Ziplock bag and seal it completely closed.

6. Place the plant in the sunlight. 

7. Invite the children to observe, take notes, draw pictures and wait.

8. After a few hours, condensation will appear on the sides of the bag and water droplets will accumulate in the bag edges or base. It is helpful to have a Ziplock or other closable bag substantially larger than the plant so as to be able to crease the bag near the leaves. This allows the water that is emitted by the leaves to settle in these “pocket” areas of the bag and thus, be easier to see the water accumulation.

9. Explain to the children that the water accumulation is from the leaves that are giving off the “used water” that they brought up from the roots. If we see water coming off the leaves, that means that it is busy making food from the sunlight! 

**NOTE:** Transpiration will take place fastest outside on a very hot day when a plant is directly in sunlight.

**Direct Aims:**
- Demonstrate the leaves’ ability to bring up water from the roots and us it to make food and then release the excess
- Learn that water vapor emitted from leaves is typically invisible but does occur
- Observe the interaction of plants and the air we breath ( the CO2 – O2 exchange between plants and humans/animals)

**Indirect Aim:**
- Prepare for future study of trees and leaves
- Develop respect for the natural environment 
- Cultivate a sense of wonder and awe 

**Points of Interest:**
- Plastic bag around the plant
- The accumulation of water
- The analogy with sweating 

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher, other children

**Variations:**
- Put the plastic bag around only one branch/ section of a larger plant/shrub using rope or bread ties to close the bag around the branch

**Extensions:**
- Do an experiment on the amount of water lost by weight: weight a broad leaf plant before the bag is put around the plant. Then, after a period of substantial transpiration [this will depend on whether the plant is indoors in which case it will take a longer amount of time or outdoors in direct sunlight in which case it will take a shorter amount of time] weight the plant again. Suggested wait time in-between weighing is at least three hours, however, this will depend on the plant size. The difference in the weight is the amount of water that has been released. Once you know the difference in weight you can estimate the volume of how much water was released by weighing various sample volumes of water. Subtracting the tare weight of the container will yield more exact estimations. 
- Though a different experiment and deemed for older students, this experiment is similar in goal:
https://www.education.com/science-fair/article/how-much-water-plants-lose-air/

- Teach the children about the stomata on a leaf- where the leaf loses the water. Show them that the leaf cleaning work helps keep dust, oils and dirt off the leaves keeping the openings clean and ready to release water and O2 into the air. A cleaner plant will yield more moisture and oxygen in the air – better air to breathe.

## The Tree

{{< img class="white-outline pure-img" src="/img/culture/botany/image020.webp" alt="Tree with massive vines" >}}

### TREES: TYPES AND PARTS OF THE TREE{.redc}

**Materials:**
- School yard, park or outdoor area with various kinds of trees
- Crayons with label paper removed (or colored wax/crayon blocks)
- 5x5 sheets of paper (about 2 for each student)
- 1-2  clipboards per group of 4-5 students

**Prerequisites:**
- Plants vs. animal 
- Types of plants

**Age:** 3 - 5 

**Presentation I:** Types and Parts of Trees
1. Gather the group of students in the selected outside area; ideally evergreens, deciduous and/or fruit or flowering trees. 

2. After reviewing any rules and behavior parameters, ask the children to make groups of about 4 students 

3. Ask each group to find three trees that are different. They should go to each tree and use their senses to learn about the tree; their eyes, their nose, their touch, etc.

{{< img class="white-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/culture/botany/image022.webp" alt="Bark Shadding" >}}

4. They should then return to the group and talk about what they learned from being close to the various trees.

5. Ask the groups of students to share various impressions from each tree. They can talk about the bark (feel); the fruit (smell or taste); the flowers (sight and smell); the leaves (smell and feel) and other characteristics they noticed. They may have heard birds, seen nests, squirrels or insects in some of the trees; they may have heard the wind through the leaves or branches; they may have seen or felt leaves, petals or pine cones drop. 

6. Engage all the students in identifying the differences of the various trees, helping the students to name/identify the differences. For example, smooth bark versus stringy bark on an oak tree vs. cedar tree respectively. 

7. Next, engage all the students in naming/ identifying the similarities of all the trees: roots, trunks, leaves, branches. 

8. Tell the students that all trees have these common elements; they are the parts of a tree: the roots which are underground (like the plant they have seen), the trunk, the branches and the leaves (which vary in sizes, textures, shapes and color). 

9. Ask the children to gather back into their groups. Distribute a few pieces of paper to each student. They ask them to choose a few (paperless) crayons per group. 

10. Ask the students to go back to the three trees they previously chose and to make two rubbings of leaves or bark or both. They children should cooperate to hold each other’s papers for the rubbing of leaves and/or bark and use clipboards when needed. 

11. Bring the student back together seated in a circle. Review the lesson objectives: the parts of a tree: the roots, the trunk, the branches and the leaves. 

**Presentation II:** Uses of trees
1. This can be done immediately following the previous lesson or within the next few days indoors with a small group or at a class gathering time.
2. Ask the children to bring to mind the parts of the trees they looked at and observed with their senses. 
3. Tell them now, you are going to share about the uses of trees for humans and animals. Engage in a discussion about the topic which can include the following:
	* Give off oxygen
	* Filter the air by removing dust and pollutants
	* Convert carbon dioxide into oxygen
	* Support wildlife (including insects) by providing shelter, shade and food (in the forms of nuts, leaves, fruit, nectar and pollen)
	* Provide timber (for human shelter)
	* Provide fuel (for burning to make heat)
	* Provide medicinal uses (roots, twigs, leaves and bark)
	* Provide decoration 
	* Conserve energy (provide shade among other things)
	* Stabilize the soil and prevent erosion
	* See more: https://www.treepeople.org/tree-benefits

4. A follow up activity to this discussion include:
	- Drawing pictures of trees
	- Writing a than you letter to a tree-planting organizations or local botanical gardens
	- Planting a tree in the school yard
	- Do a community clean up around trees or in parks

**Direct Aims:**
- Teach the children about the utility and diversity of trees
- Interact, experience and come in contact with the parts of various trees
- Engage the students in care for the natural environment

**Indirect Aim:**  
- Prepare for parts of the tree puzzle and nomenclature
- Prepare for parts of the leaf puzzle and nomenclature
- Prepare for Botany cabinet work

**Points of Interest:**
- Outdoors lesson
- Art and science lessons

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher, other children

**Variations:**
- Use photos of different trees

**Extensions:**
- Invite a guest speaker from a local Park to talk about the care of trees or another tree-related topic

### THE TREE PUZZLE{.redc}

**Materials:**
- Montessori puzzle of a tree
- Labels or paper to write tree nomenclature
- Extension: pin-punching materials
- Control for the puzzle (optional)

**Prerequisites:** 
- Types and parts of the tree or
- Interactions and discussion with real trees, preferably outdoors

**Age:** 3 - 5 

**Presentation I:** Parts of the tree puzzle
1. Invite the child to lesson. Walk to the Botany shelf with the student and then ask if they would like to work at table. This work can be done on a rug or table, but the pin-punching extension is more easily done at a table. 

2. If working on a table, place a small mat on the table first. Then place the puzzle in the middle of the table.

3. Name the lesson for the child and have the labels or the paper to write close by. 

4. Begin by saying “This is the puzzle of tree. This lesson helps us remember the parts of a tree. Let’s name them together.” 

5. Removing the roots piece and place it to the right. If a control is being used, place the roots piece on the control chart in the roots area. “These are the roots of the tree.” Write roots on a paper to take the label and ask the child to place it near the puzzle piece.

6. Remove the trunk section (one piece) and place it on the rug connected to the roots or on the control chart. Name the part, then place the label next to the tree part.

7. Remove a branch (there are at least three). If possible start with the thickest and one with few offshoots/twigs. Place it on the rug connected to the trunk or on the control chart. Name the part, then place the label next to the tree part.

8. Continue with the other branches. No need to write another label unless you choose to.

9. Choose a section of the leaves that easily fits around the branch. Put it in its place on the mat or on the control chart. Name the part, (leaves) and then place the label next to the tree part.
10. Continue with the other pieces of leaves. Optional: Name the top part of the tree as “the crown”: all the parts of the tree above the roots and trunk.

11. Invite the child to replace all the pieces of the tree in the puzzle frame. The guide can name with the child as they return the pieces. Or, the guide can ask the child to take the named piece such as, “can you replace the branch piece that is on the lower left?” 

12. Optional: point out the soil part on the puzzle; the above ground and the below ground parts of the tree.

**Presentation II:**
1. Bring green, light and dark brown construction paper, pin-punching materials and the tree puzzle to the table with the child. 

2. Tell the child that you are going to show them how to make a paper puzzle from the wooden tree puzzle.

3. Ask the child to remove the roots and place it on the light brown construction paper. Ask the child to trace around the roots with a pencil. Help the child as needed. Then ask the child to pin-punch out the roots as they do for map pieces. When they have completed, have the child put the piece aside in a safe place. 

4. Have the child continue with other branch pieces on the dark brown paper. Place these pin-punched pieces with the other 

5. Then, do the same with leaves pieces on the green paper. 

6. Have the child assemble all the pieces following the puzzle of the tree. Then mount with glue on a piece of card stock. They can color in the soil following the tree puzzle and also label with the help of the guide the parts of the tree. 

**Direct Aims:**
- Practice the parts of the tree
- Do a multi-step project 
- Converge handwriting, language, art and science into one work

**Indirect Aim:**  
- Prepare for other multi-step projects
- Practice labeling and spatial skills 
- Improve hand-eye coordination and copying a fixed pattern 

**Points of Interest:**
- Applying pin-punching to Botany works
- Making a paper puzzle

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher, other children

**Variations:**
* Change the colors of the paper
* Cut out the pieces instead of pin-punching

**Extensions:**
- Do other paper puzzles related to Botany such as the leaf.

## The Leaf


{{< spacer >}}


### LEAVES: TYPES AND PARTS OF THE LEAF{.redc}

**Materials:**
- Samples of real leaves from both indoor and outdoor plants
- Pictures of various types of leaves
- Leaf puzzle

**Prerequisites:** 
- Parts of the tree
- Plant vs. animal

**Age:** 3 - 5

**Presentation I:** Types of leaves
1. Invite a small group of children to lesson. Thank them for coming.

2. Bring the leaf samples to the rug and some paper for labels

3. Take out the first leaf for example, one from a spider plant that is bi-colored, long and narrow. Pass the leaf around and, as with other Botany lessons, have the children describe it with adjectives using their senses as the source. The leaf is flexible, green and white, soft, smooth, odorless etc.

4. Take out another leaf perhaps some pine needles and describe them with the children: thin, dark green, attached together at the base, sharp at the edge, firm yet bendable etc.

5. Continue with several different types of leaves that vary in texture, shape, size and color.

6. Invite the children to choose their favorite and to draw or write about it. 

7. If the leaves are from the school grounds, the children can go outside and find the plant, tree or shrub from which the leaves come. 

8. They can then compare their specimen to others on the plant; others may be similar but vary in color or size.  

**Presentation II:** Parts of a leaf
1. Using a real leaf, such as an oak or maple leaf place it on the rug in the center.

2. Tell the students that we are going to learn the parts of a leaf, just like we did for a tree.

3. Start at the base of the leaf. Point to the bottom, knobble end and name it as the “stipule.” Sometimes, the leaf will have two small leaf like appendages at the base; these are called stipules. The stipule varies according to the type of leaf. It can be a “bump” on a maple leaf; it is where it attaches to the stem.

4. Write the word stipule and place it on the rug next to that part of the leaf.

5. Pick the leaf up again and point to the section above the stipule (the “stem” of the leaf) and name it as the petiole. Place the leaf back down and write petiole, placing it next to this part of the leaf.

6. Pick the leaf up and point to the main broad area of the lead and name it as the blade. Place the leaf back down aligned with the other labels and write the word “blade.” Ask a child to read the word if able. Then invite them to place it next to an area of the blade. 

7. Next, pick up the leaf and point to the veins in the leaf. Name them as veins and ask the children to feel the veins. Remind them that is where the water and nutrients travel when it comes up from the roots, through the stem and through the leaves before it is released by the openings in the leaf, the stomata. 

8. Compare the veins in the leaf to other known materials such as heavy thread or thin wire. Have the students describe the veins. Examine the veins on the leaf: do they make a pattern, are they elaborate, are they parallel, curved etc. 

9. Do a three period lesson on the names seen thus far by handling the real leaf. 

10. Return the leaf to the its place on the rug and write a label for vein. 

11. Pick up the leaf and point to the very top. Name this part of the leaf as the apex. Apex means top or point. It is the top (and depending on the leaf, and point) of the leaf. Write the word apex and ask a child to read if able.

{{< div >}}Scalloped: with a scalloped margin.{{< /div >}}
{{< div >}}Palmate: like the fingers of a hand spread open.{{< /div >}}

{{< /box >}}

12. Pick up the leaf a last time and tell the children that there is one more important part of the leaf: the margin. The margin is the outer edge of the leaf. Describe the margin on the specimen leaf. It can be:
	* Jagged
	* Toothed
	* Curved
	* Straight
	* Rough
	* Smooth
	* etc.

13. Invite the children to make a rubbing of the leaf to show the veins.  


**Note:** learning the names of the margins is not the objective of this part of the lesson. Rather, it is to learn the word “margin” and be able to identify it on the leaf, that there are many different types of margins depending on the leaf. 

**Presentation II:** Leaf Puzzle
1. Bring the leaf puzzle to the rug and invite a small group of children

2. Remind them of the leaf specimens they saw previously

3. Tell them that you are going to learn the parts of the leaf with this puzzle.

4. If using the control chart for the leaf, place it to the right of the puzzle and place all pieces outlined in steps 5 – 9 on the control chart. 

5. Remove the lower most piece, the sepal, and place it to the right on the rug. Name this part of the leaf and then write the label. Invite a child to place it next to that part of the leaf. 

6. Next, move up the puzzle and take the piece of the petiole, and place it to the right on the rug. Name this part of the leaf and then write the label. Invite a child to place it next to that part of the leaf. 

7. Continue with the pieces for the veins, blade, margin and apex. Each time review the other names of the parts of the leaf with a quick guessing game, such as removing a piece and naming what is missing. The children can run the game after the first or second rounds. 

8. Continue until all the pieces are on the rug. Ask a child to play the role of the teacher and name a piece to be replaced in the puzzle frame. 
9. As with the tree puzzle, one engaging work is to pin-punch a puzzle out of paper. This can be done with several different shades of green and turn out a beautiful Botanical piece of artwork. Mount the leaf parts on a blue or other stiff backing. The child can label the leaf. 

{{< img class="white-outline float-right pure-img" src="/img/culture/botany/image027.webp" alt="Types of Leaves" >}}

**Direct Aims:**
- Teach the parts of the leaf
- Teach new botanical vocabulary 
- Raise awareness to the variety of leaves
- Execute a multi-step project

**Indirect Aim:**
- prepare for work with the Botany cabinet
- cultivate respect and admiration for nature and its wonders and diversity

**Points of Interest:**
- The new vocabulary
- The real leaf
- The venation system (particularly if it is intricate)

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher, other children

**Variations:**\
Use a different leaf than a maple or oak

**Extensions:**
- Teach the names of the venation systems by trying to find real specimens that match the pattern.

**Vocabulary:** vein, venation system, stipule, petiole, blade, apex, margin

**Source:** Kateri Carver, PhD UWRF Montessori TEP 2019

**Note:** Try to ensure having a leaf puzzle that has the margin as one or several separate piece(s).
Many leaf puzzles do not have the margin as part of the puzzle. This is a shame as this is a part of the leaf that the students really connect with because it is often the most identifying feature of a leaf; a maple jagged margin versus an oak wavy margin.

2. Following the steps from previous Botany lessons, invite the children to interact with the specimen(s) through their senses.
3. Describe with the adjectives the color, texture, size, weight and shape.  Discuss where and then we see flowers; connect flowers to various seasons.

4. The flowers may be named but this is not essential.

5. Show some other pictures of flowers for which there are no specimens. 

6. Engage the students in a creative process with the flowers. For example, play a piece of instrumental music and ask them to see which flower parts of the piece or individual instruments make them think of a specific flower, such as a daisy and the piano. Or, give them names of virtues such as patience, courage, patience, respect etc. and ask them to select a flower that represents that virtue to them. Another alternative is to design an Art activity related to flowers: how to draw flowers, drying flowers, using one real petal and drawing the rest. 

7. They can then draw and decorate their drawing of the flower and its analogy to the instrument or the virtue. This can be done by providing back and white copies of the flower and the children can then color and make the free associations they think of. 

**Presentation II:** Parts of the Flower 
1. Bring a real flower to a low table and invite a small group of children

2. Tell the children that we are going to dissect the flower to learn the parts of a flower; “dissect” means to cut up.

3. Place the lily on the cutting board with the stem and calyx at the lower edge. 

4. Begin by pointing the base of the flower, near the stem and name this part of the flower: the calyx. Carefully but deliberately cut the calyx from the corolla (all the petals). 

5. Carefully pluck a petal and name it as it is removed. Place to one side and then remove another petal place it with the other one. Continue until all the petals removed, naming each time. 

6. Then, carefully and gently pull the stamens and the pistils. (If dissecting a lily, they are all attached to a light green cylinder which is the ovary. Using the tweezers, pick up the stamens and move them to one side and name them. 

7. Next, pick up the pistil, name it and set it aside. 

8. Next, pick up the green cylinder and tell them that this is called the ovary and it is where a new flower develops and grows. 

9. Invite the children to use this work as an observation work with a magnifying glass. 

**Direct Aims:**

### FLOWER PUZZLE{.redc}

**Materials:**
* Flower puzzle
* Slips of paper
* Control chart (if desired)

**Prerequisites:** 
* Parts of the tree
* Parts of the leaf
* Parts of the real flower

**Age:** 3 - 6

**Presentation I:**
1. Bring the flower puzzle to the rug and invite a small group of children

2. Remind them of the flower specimens they saw previously

3. Tell them that you are going to learn the parts of the flower with this puzzle.

4. If using the control chart for the flower, place it to the right of the puzzle and place all pieces outlined in steps 5 - 7 on the control chart. 

5. Remove the lower most piece, the calyx, and place it to the right on the rug assembling the flower on the rug. Name this part of the flower and, if desired state its function: the calyx attaches the flower at the base to the stem. Then write the label. Invite a child to place it next to that part of the flower. 

6. Next, move up the puzzle and take the one of the pieces of the stamens, and place it to the right on the rug, assembling the flower on the rug. Take the other piece that has the stamens and place in its place on the flower being reassembled on the rug. Name this part of the flower and state its function: the stamens are the male part of the flower and have the pollen, which is like dust, usually yellow and contains the grains (like tiny seeds) that are needed for reproduction; making more flower plants. Then write the label for stamen. Invite a child to place it next to that part of the flower. You can write “stamen (male)” on the label if desired.

7. Continue with the pistil piece and place it on the rug, re-building the flower there. Name the part and state its function: the pistil is the female part of the flower; it receives the pollen and is then fertilized and makes a seed (deep inside the flower) that can grow into for a new flower plant.  Some pistils get the pollen from the male stamens from the same flower; this is a self-pollinating flower. Other flowers get pollen moved by birds, bees and insects to their pistils.  Review the other names of the parts of the flower with a quick guessing game, such as removing a piece and naming what is missing. The children can run the game after the first or second rounds. 

8. Ask a child to play the role of the teacher and name a piece to be replaced in the puzzle frame. 

9. As with the leaf and tree puzzle, one engaging work is to pin-punch a puzzle out of colored paper. This can be done with several different colors and turn out a beautiful Botanical piece of artwork. Mount the flower on a blue paper or other stiff backing. The child can label the flower


**Direct Aims:**
- Teach the names and functions of the parts of the flower
- Appreciate the complexity and diversity of flowers

**Indirect Aim:** 
- Prepare for study of flowers
- Prepare for Botany cabinet work 

**Points of Interest:**
-Flower puzzle pieces that resemble the real dissected flower

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher, other children

**Variations:**\
Use a different flower

**Extensions:**\
Use a child’s microscope to examine the parts of the flower. 

**Connections to other areas of the classroom such as Sensorial, Practical Life, Art, Language, Math:**\
List some here 

**Vocabulary:** calyx, petals, corolla, stamens, pistil, pollen, stem, reproduction

### FLOWER EXPERIMENT{.redc}

This well-known experiment is nearly always fun for children 3-6 years old. In a Montessori classroom, it is a great way to bring together the parts and their functions of plants (tree, the leaf and the flower).

### BOTANY CABINET{.redc}

**Materials:**
* Botany cabinet
* Botany cabinet cards
* Botany cabinet control chart

**Prerequisites:**
* Leaf specimen lesson
* Parts of the leaf 
* Leaf puzzle

**Age:** 3 - 5 

**Presentation I:**
1. Walk to the shelf where the Botany cabinet is kept.

2. Show the child that this is work that is different from other works. We never take the whole cabinet to the rug since it is too heavy.

3. Show the child how the drawers work- pull several out and then gently push them back in. 

4. Select one drawer and carry it to the rug. 

5. Take out one leaf and trace around the contour with one finger. Invite the child to do the same. Place on the rug to the right of the draw.  Invite the child choose another leaf to trace.

6. Trace and place all the leaves in the drawer.

7. Invite the child to trace on green paper the leaf. Then the child can cut or pin-punch the leaf out. 
8. Ask the child to use the yellow frame to trace and cut out a frame for mounting. 

9. Have the child glue the green leaf on the yellow backing. They can make a booklet of all the leaves in that drawer.

10. Continue with other drawers as interested

**Presentation II:** Cabinet with cards

11. Bring a drawer to the rug. Walk back the cabinet area and get the cards. Sometimes these are stored and organized by the thickness of the line on the card and sometimes they are stored and organized by the drawer. Occasionally, they are kept all together, but organized. There are solid green shadows of the leaf, a thick line green outline of the leaf and thin line green outline of the leaf.

12. Choice #1: visual discrimination exercise of the three different leaves. 
	- Select the SOLID cards for one of the leaves in the drawer. Lay the three cards out to the right of the drawer. Ask the child to match the puzzle piece leaf with the corresponding card. 
	- Select three more SOLID leaf card that match the leaves left in the drawer. Lay the leaf cards out to the right of the drawer. Ask the child to find the corresponding leaf pieces. 

13. Choice #2: many cards
	- Lay many cards out (first should be all solid green shadow cards); more than are in the drawer at the rug. Ask the child to match the pieces with the cards. When they have completed it, they can go get another drawer and try to find the pieces that match.

14. Choice #3: all the cards at once
	- The children can get several rugs and lay out all the cards for all the drawers.
	- They do this by starting with the sold green shadow and then placing the thick line under the solid and then the thin line under the second. They move from left to right having three rows for each leaf. They can put the leave on any of the outlines they choose. 

15. Choice #4: game of keeping the shape in the memory
	- The child sets up a series of cards (solid cards makes the memory task easier and thin line makes it harder) on a rug across the room. The child looks at a card and has to go to the cabinet to find the piece that matches. This can be played with 1-2 children. 

**Direct Aims:**
- Visual discrimination of leaf shape
- Familiarize the child with the variety of shapes of leaves
- Develop better visual discrimination skills in general

**Indirect Aim:**
- Prepare for further botany work in elementary
- Increase concentration and visual sorting skills (cards)
- Develop longer habits

**Points of Interest:**
- A large work with the cards
- The Botany/ Leaf Cabinet
- All the various types of leaves

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher, other children

**Variations:**\
Start with just one leaf instead of three

**Extensions:**\
Find similar shape of a leaf in the classroom


**Connections to other areas of the classroom such as Sensorial, Practical Life, Art, Language, Math:**\
