# Study of Multiplication

[Multiplication with Golden Bead Material](#golden-bead-multiplication)\
Multiplication is adding the same quantity over and over. An introduction to
the idea of multiplication is done using the familiar golden bead material.

[Multiplication with Stamp Game](#stamp-game---multiplication)\
Multiplication and move toward abstraction: the following lessons 
may be presented in parallel as a child begins to move toward 
abstraction with the operation of multiplication.

[Multiplication with Bead Bars](#bead-bar-multiplication)\
This material emphasizes the counting-on aspect of “____ taken ____ times”
and attaches the equation to the number story of the operation.

[Multiplication Board](#multiplication-board)\
This material introduces the multiplication fact tables.

[Multiplication with Small Bead Frame](#bead-frame--multiplication)\
(see the presentation for addition with bead frame)

[Multiplication Working Charts](#working-charts---multiplication)\
These charts are used in parallel with the other multiplication materials
and lessons. They are primarily used to encourage memorization of the fact tables. 
Chart I and Chart II are used early on as control charts.

## Golden Bead Multiplication

**Materials**
* Golden Bead Material
* Small numeral cards for the multiplicand 
* Large numeral cards for the product
* Rug that is appropriately sized for the operation activity
* Small rug to hold the boxes of numerals
* Golden Bead equation paper & pencil(s)

**NOTE:** Multiplicand x multiplier = product “213 taken 3 times is the same as 639”

**Prerequisites**
* Dynamic addition – mastery of exchanging
* Introduction to multiplication symbol
* Composing and reading numbers
* Careful counting

**Direct Aim**\
Understand that adding the same number over and over is multiplication

**Indirect Aim**
* Move toward abstraction
* Experience another way that numbers may be manipulated

**Age**\
4.5 – 5.5 years

**Presentation**\
**Presentation 1 – Static multiplication as an introduction**
1. Position the rug(s) for the operation activity. Place a small rug near the larger operations rug to hold the boxes of numeral cards.

2. Collect the small numeral cards for a four digit number and place them vertically on the upper left side of the rug - thousands at the top and ones at the bottom. Prior work will make this process of collecting numeral cards, and then composing a number, familiar to the child. An equation such as 3213 x 3 works well as an introductory equation because it does not require exchanging/regrouping. 

3. Point to the cards and read the quantity. “Three thousand, two hundred, one ten, and three ones - we are going to combine this same quantity again and again. Three times.”

4. Collect the needed numeral cards from the other two boxes of small numerals and place them vertically on the rug, under the first set of cards. Leave some space so it is clear that there are three separate sets of numeral cards. (These are not composed yet.)

5. Ask the child to retrieve and arrange the golden bead material quantity for the three sets of selected numeral cards – one multiplicand at a time. The golden bead material should be arranged horizontally as is done for addition problems: thousands to the right of the numeral cards, hundreds to the right of the thousands, tens to the right of the hundreds, and then the ones.

6. After all the gold is arranged; compose the numeral cards into numbers. “We have taken the same quantity three times.” Stack the cards as you say, “Three thousand, two hundred, one ten, and three ones. Three thousand, two hundred, and thirteen.”  NOTE: The child should have had practice reading and writing numbers by now.

7. This is a good time to show the child how to write the equation on Golden Bead equation paper. “Let me show you how we would write this number story. We will use this paper. First, I write 3213 and then I show how we took it three times by writing a 3 here and the multiplication symbol here.” Set the equation paper on the small rug.

8. “Now, we will see how much we have when we join these three quantities all together!” 
“We will write that bigger amount here.” Point to the bottom of the equation paper, where the product will be written.

9. “We start with the ones.” Move all the ones to the bottom of the rug. Use your dominant hand to count the ones (one at a time) into the palm of your subdominant hand. When the total (or ten for a dynamic problem) is reached, stop and close your hand into a fist while saying the total amount. “Nine. Nine ones.”  Arrange the ones on the rug in a column and retrieve the large 9 numeral card and place it below the one beads.

10 “Next we count the tens.” Complete the same steps with the ten bars: combine at the bottom of the rug, count into subdominant hand, record the quantity with a large numeral card placed below the beads. Repeat the same steps for the hundreds and the thousands. (“Combine, count, record. Combine, count, record.” This is a chant that will help the child when they move away from using the wooden numeral cards.)
11. After all the gold is counted, and the large numeral cards are placed to make a record of the total quantities in each hierarchy, then it is time to stack the large numeral cards to compose the product number. Move the thousands card over to the left of the rug first. Place it under the three multiplicands. Read the number as the cards are moved and stacked. “Nine thousands, six hundreds, three tens, and nine ones. That’s (point) nine thousand, six hundred, and thirty nine.”

12. “We write that number here.” Write the number on the equation paper while saying the number. “In multiplication, the total amount is called the product.”

**Presentation II – Dynamic multiplication**

Complete steps 1-8 as in Presentation I and then continue. Remind the child, “What do we do when we get ten? We exchange!”

9. “We start with the ones.” Move all the ones to the bottom of the rug. Use your dominant hand to count the ones (one at a time) into the palm of your subdominant hand. When ten is reached, stop and close your hand into a fist around the ones while saying the total amount. “Ten.  Stop.Ten ones. I need to exchange for a ten!”  

10. Go to the gold source and exchange the ten ones for a ten bar. Return to the rug and place the ten bar at the bottom of the rug, to the left of the pile of remaining ones. Continue to count the remaining ones.  Complete additional exchanges for ten bars as needed. When no more exchanges can be done, record the quantity of remaining ones by placing the appropriate large numeral card under the ones.

11 “Next we count the tens.” Complete the same steps with the ten bars: combine at the bottom of the rug (with the exchanged-for ten bars), count into subdominant hand, exchange as needed,  record the quantity with the large numeral card placed below the beads. 

Repeat the same steps for the hundreds and the thousands. (“Combine, count, exchange, record.”) This is a chant that will help the child when they move away from using the wooden numeral cards.

12. After all the gold is counted, and the large numeral cards are placed to make a record of the total quantities in each hierarchy, then it is time to stack the large numeral cards to compose the product number. Start by moving the thousands card over to the left of the rug. Place it under the three multiplicands. Read the number as the cards are moved and stacked. “Seven thousands, one hundred, eight tens, and eight ones. That’s seven thousand, one hundred, and eighty-eight.”

13. “We write that number here.” Write the number on the equation paper while saying the number. “In multiplication, the total amount is called the product.”

## Bead Bar Multiplication

**Materials**
* Box with at least 55 of each bead bar in the bead stair, including the 10 bars
* Separate box with bead bars to build the corresponding products (answers)
* Multiplication Chart 1
* Prepared Problems (tables)
* Blank slips of paper for equations
* (Strip of felt to place on work rug to isolate the operation from the supplies.)

**Prerequisites**
* Experience with short and long bead chains
* Skip counting
* Multiplication with the Golden Bead Material
* Experience composing numbers (Teens boards, Tens boards)

**Direct Aim**
* Experience multiplication as repeatedly joining the same quantity over and over
* Practice using counting on as a strategy – rather than counting from one
* Practice using tens and the short bead stairs to compose a product
* Practice writing a multiplication equation

**Indirect Aim**
* Memorize multiplication facts
* Experience the commutative property of multiplication
* Move toward abstract computation
* Further develop the mathematical mind

**Age:** 5.5 – 6 years

**Presentation**\
**Presentation I – Use one as the multiplicand to practice lesson steps & using tables.**
1. Place a red one bar horizontally on the rug. “One taken one time is…” Pick up a one bar and place it vertically under that one bar and say “…one.”

Place another one bar horizontally on the rug to the right (leaving some space) of the first one bar and then place a second one bar horizontally below it while saying, “One taken two times is…” Pick up a (green) two bar and place it vertically under those two one bars and say, “… two.”

2. Continue, being careful now to emphasize that you are counting on from the previous count. “We know that one taken two times (put two more ones down horizontally to the left) is two so one taken three times is twoooo (add another one bar to the column of two horizontal ones), three.” Pick up the pink three bar and place it vertically under the column of three horizontal one as you say, “One taken three times is (place the pink bar) three.”

3. “We know that one taken three times is three.”  (Place three one bars in a vertical column.) “One taken four times is (place down three one bars in a column) is threeeee…FOUR.”  “One taken four times is four.” (place the yellow four bar vertically under the column of four one bars.

4. Continue like this until one taken ten times is reached and a ten bar is placed under a column of ten one bars. 

5. “Now we will make a record of what we did. We will record it.” Gather the ones table paper and review each set of ones as the child writes the product on the prepared table paper. “One taken one time is one.” Point to the 1 X 1 = ____ equation.
“This is one taken five times is five. This says one taken five times is five.”

6. Repeat this presentation with the other bead bars, 2 through 9: lay out bead bars for a set, declare the product, compose the product with bead stairs, count-on with one additional bead bar for the next set, declare the product, and compose the product with bead bars.

**Presentation 2 – Use two as the multiplicand and practice writing equations on slips of paper.**\
**NOTE:** Remember to encourage the child to use the Multiplication Working Charts to confirm products – when appropriate. Place the chart a distance from the child’s work area.
1. Present the lesson as described in Presentation I AND add the idea that “sets” are being constructed and counted, also add the activity of writing the equations on slips of paper, rather than using prepared tables.

2. “Today, let’s put sets of two together using the two bead bars and see how much we get.”

3. Place a two bar horizontally on the rug…continue as in Presentation I. Add the language of “sets of two” by saying, for example, “Two taken five times is ten. This set with five twos in it is ten.” OR “Seven taken four times is twenty eight. This set with four sevens in it is twenty eight.” 
This can be emphasized by pointing to the set of bead bars being considered.

4. After the child completes the exercise and the columns of horizontally placed bead bars and the vertically placed product beads are all in place, invite the child to write the corresponding equations on slips of paper. “You already know how to fill out the multiplication table papers. Today, you will write your own equations for what happened with each set of two.”

“Here, (point) we have two taken one time is two. I write the number story like this.” Show the child how to write 2 x 1 = 2 on a slip of paper. “Here, we have two taken two times is four. I write the number story like this.” Continue for several sets. Then, pick up your papers and set them to the side.

5. Supply the child with slips of paper and a pencil. Show the child where the slips of paper are kept on the shelf.

**Presentation 3 – Use 10 as the multiplier and use a counter to “save your spot” when ten is reached**\
**NOTE:** By now, the child has worked with the tens board, the 100 chain, and the 1000 chain so is probably familiar with the idea of skip counting by 10s. This lesson connects the idea of a set of 10s.

1. “Today, let’s make sets of ten for each kind of bead bar and see how much we get.”

2. “We will start with a set of ten ones.” Place ten one bars horizontally in a column. “This is a set of ten ones and that is ten all together.” Place a ten bar vertically under the column.

3. Ask the child to create a column of ten, two bars. “We will use the counter to save our spot. Every time we get ten, we will put down a ten bar.”

4. Start the count. When you reach “ten” stop and hold the counter at the spot and place a 10 bar below the set. Continue the count with “eleven, twelve …” and when “twenty” is reached stop and say, “We need another ten bar. Twenty is two tens.” 

5. Summarize the count – declare the total. “This set of ten twos is twenty.” Repeat this exercise with each bead bar group. “This set of ten threes is thirty.” “This set of ten fours is forty.” and so on.

6. When all sets of ten are finished, invite the child to write the equations on slips of paper. “Now we will make a record of your work. You will write the story for each set on a slip of paper and place it next to that set.” Demonstrate if needed.

**Points of Interest:**
* Using the bead bars in a different way
* Discovering patterns
* Completing a familiar operation in a new way
* Movement – using control chart

**Control of Error:**
* Accurate observation and assessment by teacher to determine true readiness
* Control charts
* Prior experience

**Extensions:**\
Using the squaring chain for 10 or 5 for the first extension lesson, connect the chain (and skip counting) to multiples of that number. First, ask the child to complete placing the chain and laying out the arrows next to the appropriate bead – just as they would do the squaring chain lesson. THEN write the equation for each arrow and place the equation slip next to the arrow.. For the 5 chain, for example, there would be five slips; 0+5=5, 5+5=10, 5+5+5=15, 5+5+5+5=20, and 5+5+5+5+5=25. THEN, using loose five bars, place the five bars as you did in lesson two above, just below the equation strip. “So to get 15, we took a five bar one time (place bar) two times (place second bar) and three times (place third bar).”  “Wow, we had to write 5 a lot of times.”  “There is another way to write this. We can write (demonstrate as you say it) ‘Five taken three times equals, or is the same as fifteen.”  Then, replace the new equation strip showing multiplication with the addition equation strip next to each arrow.

**Vocabulary:**
* “We will make a record of…”
* “Here we have a number story about a set of ______...”

## Multiplication Board

**NOTE:** In Psychoarithmetic, Maria Montessori writes, “Children very much like this material used to learn the multiplication tables: they fill in six or seven forms, (equation papers for multiplication tables) one after another, an exercise that occupies them for days or weeks on end.”

This material is used in conjunction with multiplication booklets or papers that list the multiplication tables. Eventually, the child combines the Multiplication Chart I with the Multiplication Board work. In Psychoarithmetic, Montessori writes, “After the children have filled in the whole series of forms (equation papers for multiplication tables) many times, using the material (Multiplication Board) as an aid, they are offered a control table (Multiplication Working Chart I) so that they can check whether they have made any mistake in working out the multiplications. Going through the tables one after another, number by number, they check whether each product corresponds to the product entered in the corresponding column in the table. When this work is done accurately, the children have their tables, with the assurance of no errors.”  

She goes on to write, “They then copy the times tables from the forms onto a sheet of paper, in columns, ones under one, twos under two, threes under three etc.”  IMPORTANT – the “copy the times tables from the forms onto a sheet of paper” is actually part of the first Working Charts lesson. So, be sure to begin that series of lessons in a timely manner after this lesson is presented and practiced several times.

**Materials:**
Multiplication board, container of multiplicand number cards 1-10, container of 100 beads, a place marker (red disc) for multiplier, equation paper or slips, Multiplication Working Chart I will also be needed.

**Prerequisites:**
* Teen board and ten board
* Counting knowledge
* Exposure to and experience with addition

**Direct Aim:**
* Practicing process of multiplication
* Practice saying multiplication number stories
* Practice writing multiplication equations

**Indirect Aim:**
* Move toward abstraction
* Move toward memorization of 100 multiplication facts

**Age:**\
5 - 6 years

**Presentation:**

**Presentation I**\
(One equation at a time – each with a different multiplicand)
Note: Invite the child to practice sliding the cards in and out of the slot.

1. Introduce how to use this material by selecting one multiplication equation.

2. Read the equation to the child while pointing at each factor and the multiplication symbol. The child will have already been introduced to the multiplication sign while working with the golden bead material.

3. Point to the multiplicand. “The first number in this equation is called the multiplicand. It is the number we are going to add over and over.” (Point to the white cards) “These cards are for the multiplicands and slide into this slot.” (Demonstrate)

“Point to the multiplicand in our equation.” “Find the white card we need and slide it into the slot so the multiplicand is showing.”

4. We use this red marker (disc/skittle) to remind us how many times we are going to multiply ___”  

Ask the child: “Point to the number in our equation that tells us how many times we are going to add ____ over and over.”

“Put the red marker right above that number.”

5. Repeat the equation while pointing to the identified components on the board.

6. Begin the count. “Six taken four times is…(start placing the first column of beads) one, two, three, four, five, six. That is one time. One, two, three, four, five six. That is two times. One, two, three, four, five, six. That is three times. One, two, three, four, five, six. That is four times.

7. “So, six taken four times makes this many (use hands to “frame” the rectangle). We will count into this container: one, two, three…twenty-three, twenty-four.” “Six taken four times makes twenty-four.”

**Presentation II**\
(Completing a multiplication table of facts for same multiplicand)
NOTE: In Montessori’s Psychoarithmetic when describing the Multiplication Board lesson, Montessori writes, “The movement of the disc, whose purpose is to indicate the new multiplier in turn, requires the child to pay constant attention and be absolutely accurate in what he is doing.” She describes this as a material designed to aid the child in memorizing multiplication facts, “Through repetition of the same exercise, the child will convert the practical activity into the ability to retain the combinations of multiplication in the memory.”

Also, it is worth noting that in Psychoarithmetic, when describing how to use the Multiplication Board, Montessori does not emphasize placing the beads in a more visual way (filling in a rectangle) and then going on to complete the count at the end of this exercise by removing the beads and placing them into a separate container (as in done in Presentation I).  Presentation I is offered as an introductory lesson to familiarize the child with the material.

1. Insert the multiplicand card in the slot on the left side of the board and retrieve the multiplication table paper for this multiplicand. (6x1, 6x2, 6x3, 6x4, etc.)

2. Place the red disc above the 1 along the top of the board. This marks the multiplier. So, now, the board is illustrating the equation 6x1. “We are going to take 6 (point) 1 (point) time.”

3. Count, “One, two, three, four, five, six,” while placing six beads in the first vertical column. 
“Six (point) taken one (point) time makes six (point, moving finger top to bottom along column).” 

4. Record the answer on the multiplication table paper while repeating the equation: “Six taken one time makes six.” Write down six as the product.

5. Leave the beads on the board. Slide the red disc marker to the next multiplier, 2. Point to the next equation in the table booklet and read, “Six taken two times.” Then, go back to the board and repeat the equation while pointing at the multiplicand and multiplier.

6 “Six taken two times…”  “Six taken one time was six (point to the first column, pointing while moving finger over the vertical column of six beads) and six taken two times is (point to the ‘six’ bead) six…(start adding second column of beads) seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.” It is important to model the strategy of counting on.

7. Record the answer on the multiplication table paper while repeating the equation: “Six taken two times makes twelve.” “Twelve.” (Point to the twelve bead to emphasize where you finished the count.) Write down twelve.

8. Leave the twelve beads on the board. Slide the red disc marker to the next multiplier, 3. Point to the next equation in the table booklet and read, “Six taken three times.” Then, go back to the board and repeat the equation while pointing at the multiplicand and multiplier.

9. “Six taken three times…” “Six taken one time was six, (point to the 6 bead) six taken two times was twelve (point to the 12 bead) and six taken three times makes … (start adding the third column of beads) thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.”

10. Record the answer… and continue until all the products are filled in.

11. Ask the child to read the equations. Ask, “Look at these number stories, which one says six taken four times?” “Look at your paper and tell me, what is six taken eight times?” and other questions like this to assess if the child understands how to apply the equations.

**Points of Interest:**
* Moving the place holder
* Placing the beads in depressions

**Control of Error:**
* The teacher’s power of observation and accurate determination of child’s readiness
* The child’s experience and success with previous lessons

**Variations:**
Multiply real life items – such as 2 shoes for each of 5 children – two taken five times

**Extensions:**
Other multiplication materials

**Vocabulary:**
* “_____ taken ___ times is the same as ____.”
* “_____ taken ___ times, makes ____.”
* Multiplicand and Multiplier
* Factors and Product

## Stamp Game - Multiplication

**Materials**
* Stamp game
* Two sets of small numeral cards & one set of large numeral cards OR a prepared equation sheet
* “x” and “=” signs if using numeral cards
* Scissors and string/yarn OR thin strips of felt OR dowels to separate each number’s stamps
* NOTE: this work is most easily completed on a table because the stamps will slide, unlike a work rug. A floor table (turned with the short side to the child) may improve a child’s ability to move/reach comfortably. Also, be aware that some children may find it distracting to maintain a straight string or piece of felt and will do better with a wooden dowel or no physical separators.

**Prerequisites**
* Multiplication with the golden bead material
* Addition with the stamp game
* Association between golden beads, stamps, and numerals
* Fine motor coordination

**Direct Aim**
* Experience the process of multiplication as repeated addition using less concrete materials
* Practice the process of a two handed exchange

**Indirect Aim**
Grow toward abstraction

**Age**\
5.5 – 6 years

**Presentation**\
**NOTE:** Use 3 or 4 as the multiplier for the first lesson so the equation layout does not look like an addition problem. The child will have already completed addition with the stamp game.

1. If using the numeral cards, compose the multiplicand number to the left side of the table. Ask the child to read the number. Then, retrieve and point to the multiplier card. “This tells us how many times we need to gather this (point) number. Four times.”

2. “We will need the multiplication sign to help tell our number story. We will need the equal sign too.”  Ask the child to retrieve these and build the equation.

OR, use a prepared equation on a piece of equation paper. By now, the child will be ready to use a prepared equation paper because they have worked with the golden bead material successfully.

 3. “Okay, it is time to lay out the quantity of stamps for this number --- four times.”  Read the number again. Collect the stamps, just as the number is read, start with the thousands. Place the stamps in columns using the box as a guide for where to place the columns on the table.

**NOTE:** Consider placing the stamps within a hierarchy in columns of five. This creates a five frame or ten frame opportunity which encourages the child to subitize and quickly organize stamps for exchanging. It also has the side benefit of keeping the equation operation more compact so it will fit on a table more easily.

4. After placing the number’s stamps one time, place the separator (yarn, string, felt strip, dowel) and say, “Now, we will lay out the quantity of stamps again. Then we will have taken this number, _____, two times.” Confirm with the child how many times the number will be collected.

5. Invite the child to place the remaining quantity of stamps.

6.  “There. We have _______, ______ times. That is what our equation told us to do.”  “Now, we will organize these stamps to see how much we have all together.”

7. “When we read a number we start with the thousands. When we work with a number we start with the ones.” Start with the ones and bring each hierarchy of stamps to the bottom of the table and organize in columns of five. If there are more than two columns of five, push two together to create a two by five array of ten. This will make needed exchanges very clear and encourage the child to subitize the remaining amount – counting from one each time  to determine if there is a set of ten is not desirable.

8. “Remember, if we get ten, we need to exchange.” If exchanging is needed, perform a two handed exchange and place the collected stamp in the next hierarchy, continuing to try to build columns of five.

9. Record the final count for each hierarchy on the equation paper before moving on to the next hierarchy.


**Points of Interest**
* Sliding the stamps and exchanging
* New operation with familiar material
* Writing the product
* Repetition of quantity – big work
* Reading big numbers

**Control of Error**
* Accurate observation by teacher to determine true readiness
* Seeing that quantities match the amount
* Hearing the correct language when reading the equation

**Variations**\
Children may write the equation on equation paper – copy a laminated equation card.

**Extensions**\
Multiplication with short bead stairs - parallel

## Bead Frame – Multiplication

**Materials:**
* Small bead frame
* Bead frame paper
* Green, blue, and red pencils

**Prerequisites:**
* Multiplication with stamp game and other materials
* Coordination, Concentration Order
 
**Direct Aim:**
* Use more abstract material for multiplication
* Reinforce place value in the decimal system

**Indirect Aim:**
* To develop an understanding of the standard algorithm for exchanging in dynamic multiplication
* To prepare for abstract computation
* To support the mathematical mind development

**Age:** 5.5-6 years

**Presentation 1: Static multiplication with bead frame**
1. Move all the beads to the left side of the bead frame. Review the bead frame paper with the child. Numbers are written on top of the colored line
2. Select a static problem and record it on the bead frame paper
3. Work with one number at a time. Keep the pointer finger from the subdominant hand pointing to the number that corresponds with the beads being moved. The other hand is holding a pencil that will move the beads. Use the pencils point to slide the beads one at a time all the way to the other side of the frame. 
4. Start with the units. If you’re multiplying 1111 by 2, move the unit over twice, then the tens, 100s, and 1000s.
5. Read the equation.

**Presentation 2: Dynamic Addition with Bead Frame**
1. Follow the same procedure as static addition, until an exchange needs to happen because ten is reached
2. To execute an exchange, when the 10th bead is move to right (for any order) say “Exchaaange” as you slide all 10 beads from the lower order back to the left side of the frame then immediately slide one bead from the next highest order to the right, and the, immediately continue the count where you left off.
3. Continue the same way for the 10’s, 100’s and 1000’s

**Points of Interest:**
* Sliding the beads with the point of the pencil
* Using a new material with a familiar process
* Working to complete equations quickly- especially when exchanging

**Control of Error:**
* Accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness
* Visual- seeing the number of beads moved, or remaining, doesn’t make sense

**Variations:**\
Making the equations easier or harder based on the child

**Extensions:**
* Large bead frame material
* Memorize addition facts

### Chart I

**Presentation for Chart I:**
NOTE: Before this presentation, this chart should have been used by the child as an “answer key” or “control chart” to check single digit equation work with the multiplication board, and perhaps with the bead bar multiplication lesson, or to check the arrow sequence for the squaring chains. Remember, when the chart is used in this way, it should be placed a distance from the child. The child walks to the chart, finds the answer, and then holds the equation and answer in his/her mind during the walk back to the work area. This is one way the older children begin to experience the idea that math facts may simply be remembered. The “brain” can be seen as a tool/material. 

Chart I and the Passage from Chart I to Chart II:
1. Ask the child to copy all the multiplication facts from Chart 1 onto the provided paper. (Paper should appear as Chart 1 but without the equations. It can be made easily using the table building function in Microsoft Word, landscape, legal size paper OR ledger size paper.)

2. “You created a chart with the 100 math facts it is important to know.” “I can show you a way to save a lot of time – you will only need to learn half!”

3. “Let’s get started.” Read the first fact. “1 x 1 = 1.” (Pause and examine the paper.) “That is true, and there is no other fact on the board like that one. So, this fact must remain here. It stays.”

4. Move DOWN the chart and continue reading: “1 x 2 = 2. (Point out, to the right.) 2 x 1 = 2. Hmmm. They are the same, so we can eliminate one. (Cross out 2x1=2 with the red pencil, or cover with a pink slip of paper.)

5. Continue DOWN the column and read “1 x 3 = 3. (Point to the right.) Here, I see it again. (point) 3 x 1 = 3. Hmmm. So, THESE are the same too. You can see that 1 x 3 = 3 and 3 x 1 = 3, so, we can eliminate the second one.” (Cross out 3 x 1 = 3 with the red pencil, or cover with a pink slip of paper.) “Do we see any more duplicates of 1 x 3?” (Move your finger across the rows – scanning for duplicate equations.) “No. So, we’ll go on to the next one.” (Slide your finger down to 1 x 4 = 4.)

6. Here, you could ask the child to identify the duplicate equation for which you are searching. It may sound like this: “Next, we have 1 x 4 = 4. So, what are we looking for? What will the duplicate equation look like? What will we need to eliminate?” The child should say, “4 x 1 = 4,” and this will provide positive assessment information.

NOTE: Crossing off with an ERASEABLE red pencil works well. The pink paper slips tend to move around. The paper with crossed-off equations is also easier to “pause” until the next day. If slips of paper are used, consider the smallest size Post-It Notes that are available in a variety of colors, including pink. There are two advantages to Post-It slips. First, the slips of paper have adhesive on one edge so they won’t move around, and second, if the child makes an error, (when you leave them to complete the process independently) it is easy to adjust/correct. Of course, the size of the small Post – It Notes should be considered when creating the empty table so they fit nicely in the equation cells. A red pencil is also easier on the classroom budget.

### Chart II:


**Presentation for Chart II**

1. After the child creates a chart based on the commutative property by crossing out all duplicate equations on Chart I, show them Chart II – which is the result of this work.

2. Complete an assessment exercise by asking the child to find facts that do not appear on Chart II, such as “8 x 5” or “9 x 6´or “5 x 3.” The unlisted duplicate equation should be provided to the child in written form and the teacher should read it with the child. The child should recognize that 5 x 8 is a duplicate of 8x5. This will add other piece of assessment information for the teacher. “Use this chart and tell me the answer to this equation (show them written equation) eight taken five times.”

3. Provide several opportunities to use Chart II and to apply an understanding of the commutative property to complete equations.




### Chart III:

{{< figure class="pure-img" src="/img/math/multiplication/image035.webp" alt="Working Charts Multiplication" caption="(colored image of Chart III is from familyfecs.com)" >}}

{{< /grid-table >}}


**Presentation for Chart III:**

1. Child selects an individual multiplication problem. (This can be from a provided table of multiplication fact equations on a page or in a booklet, loose slips of equation papers prepared and ready for the child to enter the product, or from equations copied from tiles in the multiplication equation box.)

2. After saying the equation out loud, the child places the left hand’s pointer finger on the vertical, red multiplicand strip and the right hand’s pointer finger on the horizontal, blue multiplier strip. 

3. Move the left finger across, being careful to stay in the same row. Move the right finger down, being sure to stay in the same column. The cell at which the fingers intersect is the answer – the “product.”

4. To encourage memorization, the chart and the equation paper/recording paper could be in different areas of the room. This will require the child to hold the equation and product in his/her mind while walking back to the table with the multiplication table paper and pencil.

### Chart IV:

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/math/multiplication/image037.webp" alt="Working Charts Multiplication" >}}

{{< /grid-table >}}


**Presentation for Chart IV:**

1. Child selects an individual multiplication problem. (This can be from a provided table of multiplication fact equations on a page or in a booklet, loose slips of equation papers prepared and ready for the child to enter the product, or from equations copied by the child from tiles retrieved from the multiplication equation box.)

2.  Both factors (the multiplicand and the multiplier) are located on the vertical red strip. One pointer finger on one number, and one pointer finger on the other number. BOTH fingers are on the red strip. The smaller number “goes first” and this will always be the number closest to the top of the board.

3. Move the finger on the smaller number all the way to the end of its row – so as far to the right as possible. Keep it there…

4. Now, move the other finger (on the greater number) to the right in its row but stop in the column also occupied by the other finger. This (greater number) finger is now resting on the resulting product of the two factors – the answer.


### Chart V:

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/math/multiplication/image042.webp" alt="Working Charts Multiplication" >}}


{{< /grid-table >}}

**Presentation for Chart V:**

1. The square product tiles are sorted into sets of common products and the columns are arranged in numerical order from 4 through 100.

2. Children may select equations from the equation box, prepared tables. (Or, the child may work without equation slips or tables and use the chart to inspire equations.)

3. After the child identifies a problem, reads it, and moves their fingers from the multiplicand and multiplier to determine the product’s place on the board, the child then declares the product and subsequently finds and places the corresponding tile on the board. The child is remembering these multiplication facts based on other work.

4. Once the entire board is filled with the product tiles, it can be confirmed by using Chart III as a control.

**Points of Interest:**
* Realizing that the facts can be remembered
* Moving fingers accurately to find the correct product
* Realizing that the commutative property works for multiplication too
* Finding equivalents

**Control of Error:**
* Control Charts
* Accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness


**Extensions:**
1. Start by choosing a product tile and then the child identifies a corresponding equation and places the tile appropriately on the board.
2. Teacher chooses a tile and asks for the child to identify the multiplier after being given the multiplicand and the product.
