The following are excerpts from the “Fractions” section in Maria Montessori’s Psychogeometry, ©2011 Montessori Pierson Publishing Company, reprinted in English in 2013, 2018:

* A fraction is part of a unit. Its maximum limit is the unit itself, because once it reaches 1 it is no longer a fraction. A fraction is therefore one of the parts (a fraction, a fragment) of a broken or divided unit. The fraction is therefore represented as the unit divided into parts, i.e. ½, ½, ¼, 1/5, etc.

* The fraction always contains two numbers and a symbol between them indicating division. The number above the symbol is called the numerator. The number below the symbol is called the denominator. The larger the denominator, the smaller the fraction.

* Nothing lends itself so well to representing fractions as the circle and the angles that can be measured by the same. As a fraction of the circle, the degree is 1/360.

* Our material includes ten metal circles…

### Fraction Skittles

**Materials:**
* Four wooden skittles:
* One whole skittle
* One skittle cut into halves
* One skittle cut into thirds
* One skittle cut into fourths

**Prerequisites:**
* Counting
* Geometric Solid – cone and sphere
* Fine motor control

**Direct Aim:**
* Introduce the concept of fractions: “A whole can be divided, or cut, into equal parts.”
* Experience whole, half, third, and fourth in a concrete manner
* Experience vocabulary associated with fractions
* Experience writing fraction symbols

**Indirect Aim:**
* Preparation for math operations and activities involving fractions
* Contribute to developing the Mathematical Mind

**Age:**\
4 – 4.5 years

**Presentations**\
**Presentation I**\
(Sensorial exploration – no language)
NOTE: Some environments use a small rubber band around the knob part of the skittle to hold the parts together on the tray.

1. Begin with the whole skittle. Remove it from the tray and explore it with your hands – similar to the approach used with the geometric solids material. After exploring the whole skittle, invite the child to explore the skittle. Then, return it to the tray and remove the next skittle – the half.

2. Complete this exercise with each of the other skittles. Compare the parts of the skittle and examine how they fit together to form a whole. Count how many parts are in each skittle set. Compare the bases of the parts.

3. Invite the child to explore each skittle before you return it to the tray.

**Presentation II**\
(Naming the parts of the whole)
NOTE: This lesson can be done with more than one child at a time. For example, it works well to have two children for the half lesson, three for the thirds lesson, and four for the fourths lesson.

1. Bring the whole skittle and the half skittle to the mat.

2. “This is one whole skittle.” “It is this tall.” (Show with your hands.)

“It looks like a cone with a sphere on top.” (Show with your hands.) \
“It is this big on the bottom.” (Lift it up and trace the bottom edge with two fingers – much like the circles in the geometric cabinet.)\
“This is one whole skittle.” (Place the whole skittle at the top of the rug.)

3. Retrieve the half skittle and repeat step 2 while holding the parts together so that the skittle is actually seen as a whole.

“This is a whole skittle too. It is this tall. It looks like a cone with a sphere on top.”\
 Then, continue with, “EXCEPT, this skittle is different. It can be separated into two parts!”

4. “This is how we separate the parts.” Place the skittle (still pushed together to form a whole) in front of you. Hold by the sphere at the top – one hand holds one part while the other hand holds the other part. 

5. Simultaneously, gently and slowly, pull the TOP of the parts apart while the base stays close together. Both parts should now lay flat the rug with the colored face showing. (It is as if each part did a “Trust Fall” straight back.) In some environments, the teacher makes a soft cracking sound when the parts are separated.

6. “We cut THIS whole into TWO parts.” “We call each part HALF.”\
“This is half.” (point)\
“And, this is half.” (point)

7. “I will give you half.” (Give one part to the child.)\
“I will get half.” (Teacher picks up the other half.)\
Model examining the half. Place your palm on the flat face and trace the base with two fingers.

8. Establish that the parts are the same. “Let’s see if the base is the same on our parts.” Connect the bases. “Yes! Each half has the exact same base. Each half is the same.”\
“Let’s see if they are the same height.” Place the parts next to each other. “Yes! Each half is the exact same height. Each half is the same.”

9. Make a summary statement.\
“We cut one whole into TWO equal parts. Each part is called half.”

10. Make it whole again and place the skittle next to the whole skittle at the top of the mat.\
“Let’s put it back together.” Place your part, upright, next to the whole skittle at the top of the rug. Invite the child to place the other part next to the teacher’s part to make a whole skittle.\
“There. Now we have a whole skittle again.”

11.  On a different day, introduce the thirds and fourths skittles using the same approach described above.. Start with the whole skittle and then compare to the new skittle. When separating the thirds skittle and the fourths skittle, push back/down (“Trust Fall” back) one skittle part at a time so the formation looks like three (or four) equally spaced clock hands with the bases at the center and the sphere part of the skittle pointing outward. The colored face should be visible/face upwards.

**Summary statements:**\
“We cut one whole into THREE equal parts. Each part is called a third.”\
“We cut one whole into FOUR equal parts. Each part is call a fourth.”\
**NOTE:** Alternative language - whole, one half, one third, and one fourth.

12. When a child has been introduced to all the skittles, complete the three-period lesson.


**Presentation III**\
(Associating the fraction symbols – Telling the story)

**NOTE:** The elementary math curriculum includes extensive work with fractions. This lesson simply introduces the idea of how to write 1 whole, half, third, and fourth. Use a pencil and small square parts of paper to create the fraction symbol labels. Square Post-It notes work well because you can affix the label to the skittle part. No need to color code paper or pencil color to the skittles.

1. Bring the tray of skittles to a work rug. “Today, I am going to show you how to write the number story that goes with these fraction skittles.”

2. Review the names of the skittle fractions: whole, half, third, fourth. “First, let’s remember what we know about these fraction skittles.”

“This is a whole skittle. It does not get cut into parts. It stays whole.”

“This is a whole skittle. But, it is special. It gets cut into TWO parts.” (Separate the parts and arrange as in Presentation II.) “Each part is called HALF.”

“This is a whole skittle. But, it is special too. It gets cut into THREE parts.” (Separate the parts and arrange as in Presentation II, Step 11.) “Each part is called a THIRD.”

“This is a whole skittle. But, it is special too. It gets cut into FOUR parts.” (Separate the parts and arrange as in Presentation II, Step 11.) “Each part is called a fourth.”

3. “Now, let’s write the number story for each of these four skittles.” 

4. Consider the whole skittle. “This is one whole skittle that stays one whole skittle. It doesn’t get cut into parts. So we write ‘1’ for its story.”   Write “1” on the paper and place the label on/next to the whole skittle.

5. Consider the half skittle. “This is one whole skittle that we cut into two parts that are exactly the same.” “Here is how we write the number story for this skittle.”

“We started with one whole skittle.” (Write “1” on the top half of the paper.)
“Then, we CUT it…” (Make a line under the “1” in a quick, cutting way as you say “cut it.”)
“…and made TWO parts that were the same.” (Write a “2” under the line as you say “two.”)

“THAT is how to write ‘half’ for this skittle’s two parts.” (Create another label as you repeat the number story, “We started with one whole skittle and then we cut it and made two parts that were exactly the same.”)

(Point to a skittle half) “This is half.” 

(Place the label next to/on the skittle part.) “This says half.”
(Point to the other skittle half) “This is half.”

(Place the label next to/on the skittle part.) “This says half.”

**NOTE:** Use ½, ½ AND ⅓⅓⅓ etc. Do NOT use 1/3 on one part, 2/3 on the next part, and 3/3 on the third part. Each part is one-third of the whole and 2/3 is not used until two of the parts are combined and one label is created for the set of two parts. THAT comes later. (image from makingmontessoriours.com)

6. Consider the third skittle.\
Repeat the steps in 5 above.

7. Consider the fourth skittle.\
Repeat the steps in 5 above.

8. Same day, and/or different day, perform a three-period lesson for associating quantity and symbol.

**Points of Interest:**
* Skittles are like puzzles
* Color face exposed when separated
* New words

**Control of Error:**
* Accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness
* Color – each skittle displays a different color on the inner faces
* Form a whole – each set of skittle segments forms a whole skittle when combined correctly

**Extensions:**\
All the transition-to-fraction-inset lessons: trace bottoms of skittles, color in the outline, then label OR match skittles to purchased cards OR trace bases, color, label, cut out, and glue on cards

**Vocabulary:**\
Whole, half, third, fourth\
(One whole, one half, one third, one fourth)\
“A whole can be divided, or cut, into equal parts.” “Each part has a name.”

### Transition from Fraction Skittles to Fraction Circles – Extension Activities

**NOTE:** These extension activities will be added during Face to Face sessions.

**Materials:**
* Tray of skittles
* Paper
* Pencils – writing pencil and coloring pencils
* Scissor
* Glue
* Squares of cardstock weight paper

**Prerequisites:**
* Fraction skittle lesson
* Strong Fine Motor Skills
* Demonstrated skill holding a pencil, cutting with a scissor, using glue

**Direct Aim:**\
Create a connection between the 3D fraction skittles and the flat, 2D fraction (metal inset) circles

**Indirect Aim:**\
Prepare for future fraction lessons

**Age:** 4 – 4.5 years

**Presentation I:**
1. Bring the fraction skittles to the prepared work space
2. Bring the whole, ½, 1/3,and ¼ fraction circles to the same work space
3. Hold the whole fraction skittle slightly over the whole fraction circle, trace the fraction skittle saying “one/whole” and then trace the fraction circle, saying, “one/whole.” Follow that same pattern for ½, 1/3, and ¼.  Then, say, “Did you know we can divide one/whole into even smaller parts?”
4. Retrieve the 1/5 fraction circle from the shelf.  Draw attention to how the circle has “five equal parts.  Each part is called 1/5.”

**Presentation II:**
1. Bring the fraction circles up to 1/5 to the work space.  Complete the three-period lesson.  Once the child demonstrates mastery of the one through 1/5 fraction circles, explain, “We have even more ways to divide one whole into even smaller parts.”
2. Introduce the 1/6-1/10 fractions in the same manner.  Start with tracing the whole with your finger, saying one whole, then taking out one piece, naming it, “one of six, or 1/6” “one of seven or 1/7” etc.  

**Points of Interest:** The fraction circles are similar to puzzles.  Each piece is equal in size to another in the fraction circles.  The one whole can be divided into many parts.

**Control of Error:** The guide and the material are the control of error; the pieces of the fraction circles all have to fit just perfectly to be correct.

**Extensions:** At first, children should work with just one fraction circle at a time, but as they continue to work towards mastery, one can start letting them work with two or more fraction circles with the fractions mixed up at a time.  

**Vocabulary:** 1/6, 1/7, 1/8, 1/9,1/10

### Fraction Circles (Metal Inset Fraction Trays)

**Materials:** Ten equally sized round metal insets. Each inset is divided into a different number of equal parts. The number of parts ranges from one (whole) to ten (tenths) and the parts each have a knob to grasp to move the part.

**Prerequisites:**
Fraction Skittles
(Metal Insets from Language Area would be helpful)

**Direct Aim:**
Experience fractions in a concrete manner
Experience fractions with a material that prepares the child for elementary lessons

**Indirect Aim:**
Prepare for math operations using fractions
Practice with the vocabulary associated with fractions
Develop mathematical mind – organization of ideas around whole and parts

**Age:** 5 years

**Presentations**

**Presentation I**\
(Sensorial Exploration)

1. Carry the circles with the whole, half, and thirds insets to a table. Each can be carried separately, or the three may be placed on a carrying tray.

2. Remove each part from the frame and place them on the table below the corresponding inset frame. Return to each group of pieces. Explore each piece with your hands. Trace the edges of the inset pieces with your fingers. Compare the half fraction pieces to each other to establish that they are the same and compare the third fraction pieces to each other to establish that they are the same too.

3. Repeat this presentation with other Fraction Circles on a different day.

4. Demonstrate how to place the replace the fraction pieces into the frames.

**(FRACTION EQUIVALENCY DEMONSTRATION – another Sensorial demonstration)**\
To show that each of the Fraction Circles is equivalent to the whole, use the frame of the whole circle. Bring both trays of Fraction Circles to a table. Remove the whole. Slide the frame directly under the half circle inset. 

Remove each of the two pieces, one at a time and place them into the frame of the whole. 

“These pieces together are the same as one whole.” Replace the pieces into their original frame.

Slide the empty whole’s frame to the next inset, the thirds. Repeat the process of placing the pieces into the whole’s frame to demonstrate, “These pieces together are the same as one whole.”

Do this for all of the Fraction Circles.

**Presentation II**\
(Associating language with material)

1. Repeat steps 1-3 of Presentation I.

2. Introduce the language associated with each Fraction Circle: whole, halves, thirds, fourths. Use an approach similar to that applied when introducing this language with the Fraction Skittle material. 

“This is one whole circle. It cannot be broken to parts. It is called ONE whole.” (Place the whole circle directly under its frame).

“This is one whole circle too. (point) But it can be broken into TWO parts that are exactly the same. Each part is called half.” 
(Remove each half, one at a time as you say “can be broken.” Then, place the two halves against each other, like cymbals but with no sound, as you say, “are exactly the same.” Place the two pieces directly under the frame as you say, “Each part is called half.”)

“This is one whole circle too. But, it can be broken into THREE parts that are exactly the same. Each part is called a third.”
(Remove each third, one at a time as you say “can be broken.” Then, hold one of the third pieces and place the other two thirds against it, like cymbals but with no sound, as you say, “are exactly the same.” Place the three pieces directly under the frame as you say, “Each part is called a third.”)

3. If the child seems ready, continue to introduce other Fraction Circles. Complete a second period review after each new Fraction Circle is introduced.

4. Demonstrate how the circles are reconstructed and returned to the shelf.

**Presentation III**\
(Tracing the Fraction Circles)

1. Carry two Fraction Circles to a table.

2. Retrieve paper and pencil designated for this work. 

3. To create a traced Fraction Circle, first build the complete fraction circle on the paper. Remove all but one piece. This will provide the proper placement of the first piece so the circle, when finished, fits on the paper nicely. 

4. Trace the first piece. Trace the subsequent pieces so that the Fraction Circle is reproduced on the paper. 

5. Repeat these steps with the second Fraction Circle. Use a new piece of paper or the back of the already-used paper.

**Presentation IV**\
(Fraction families – how to write and read fraction notation)\
This presentation is reproduced directly from Xavier University spring 2010 album

1. Repeat the third presentation, steps 1-3

2. Ask the child, “How many members are in your family?”

3. Point to the inset traced on one side of the paper. If it were halves, you would say, “This is the family of halves. There are two members.”

4. Say, “We have a special way to write it. We draw a line and we write a two under the line.” Draw a fraction line with a two below it next to each half on the paper. Adjust this language and the numeral written according to the inset the child traced. A line with the appropriate numeral under it should be written next to each piece of the inset traced.

5. Point to each piece of the inset tracing. If it were halves, point to one half and say, “This is one member of the family of halves: one-half.” Write a one above the fraction line next to the half. Point to the other half and say, “This is also one member of the family of halves: one-half.” Write a one above the fraction line next to the half. Tell the child that we write it this way to show that this piece is a part of the half family. Adjust this language and the numerals used to correspond to the inset traced.

6. Return the materials to their places.

**NOTE:** In step 4 above, the teacher could introduce the word “denominator” and in step 5 the word “numerator” could be introduced.

**Points of Interest:**
* Material is like a series of small puzzles
* Tracing pieces
* Labeling pieces
* Coloring in traced pieces

**Control of Error:**
* Accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness
* Inset frames show if pieces do not build a whole


**Extensions:** children could color designated fraction circles on paper….children could be given the written fraction (1/2) and a circle and be told to show the written number story on the circle

### Fraction Cut Outs Box

(labeled fraction pieces/made of hard plastic)\
**NOTE:** At the primary level, this material could be used by a child who is very interested in fractions to explore equivalencies. Fraction insets and fraction skittles are on the AMS suggested materials list for primary classrooms. This material is not. It is found in lower elementary environments.

**Materials:**\
Box of cut out and labeled fraction pieces. Each fraction family has its own section in the box.
Several cards with one circle on each card – the circle is the size of one whole circle from the box

**Prerequisites:**
* Fraction Skittles
* Fraction Circles
* Writing fractions
* Reading fractions

**Direct Aim:**\
Explore fraction equivalencies

**Indirect Aim:**
* Prepare for future fraction lessons and operations
* Exposure to writing fraction equations

**Age:** 5 years

**Activities:**\
**Activity I**\
Build a whole from each fraction family. This will serve as a review of the skittle and fraction circle lessons.

**Activity II**\
The fraction pieces can be used to find different combinations of making one whole. 
The child may “build” a whole inside a circle template using a variety of fraction pieces.
The number story can then be recorded as an addition equation. For example: 
½ + ¼ + ¼ = 1 
This activity is similar to “making tens” with the red and blue rods, bead bars, strip board etc.

**Activity III**\
The child may also illustrate how a whole was created (using fraction pieces from different families) by tracing the pieces to form a whole circle and then labeling each piece on the traced work. This is a visual representation of recording the number story.

**Points of Interest:**
* Creating wholes from the fraction pieces
* Labeling the parts of the whole

**Control of Error:**
* Accurate observation of teacher to determine readiness
* Pieces must fill, and fit inside, the circle without overlapping or leaving empty space
