## Introduction to Numbers



### Red & Blue Number Rods

**Materials:**  Ten rods, graded in length, with the shortest at ten centimeters long (“one”) and with alternating painted sections of red and blue.

**Prerequisites:**  The child should have worked with the red rods, be familiar with hearing the language of numerals & one-to-one correspondence, and have skills of grasping, grading, balance, and coordination. (The child should work with the sandpaper numerals before the upcoming presentation for corresponding quantity with symbol).

**Direct Aim:**
* Practice arranging rods in numerical order according to length
* Acquire a concept of number
* Memorize the sequence of numbers 1-10

**Indirect Aim:**
* Preparation for associating a quantity with a symbol
* Preparation for the decimal system
* To develop order, concentration, coordination, and independence

**Age:** 3-3.5

**Presentations:**\
Note: Presentations are based on child’s levels of understanding; sensorial level, then naming level, then higher order thinking level.

**Presentation I (sensorial level – uses two rugs, preferably with no fringe)**

{{< figure class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/math/intro-num/image001.webp" alt="Red Blue Number Rods" caption="Randomly placed on the rug" >}}

1. Remove rods from shelf, carrying with one hand on each end and place randomly on one of the two work rugs.  Start by carrying the shortest rod to the rug. Continue transferring the rods from the shelf, one rod at a time, and place randomly on a rug.

2. When all the rods are placed, slide each rod so that the short side, and a red segment, of each rod lines up with the left side of the rug. 

{{< figure class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/math/intro-num/image002.webp" alt="Red Blue Number Rods" caption="Left aligned red ends on the rug" >}}

 “Now, we will order these according to length.” 

3. Begin to grade the rods. Start with the longest rod and place it at the top of the second rug. The second rug could be placed a short distance away to promote movement and allow the child to practice carrying the rods with one hand on each end. Return to the first rug for another rod. “Now, which one is the longest?”  Continue until all rods have been transferred to the second rug, longest at the top and shortest at the bottom.

{{< figure class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/math/intro-num/image003.webp" alt="Red Blue Number Rods" caption="Grade by length; longest at top" >}}

4.  Slide the shortest rod over to the right end of each rod, in turn, starting with the two rod. This visually shows that attaching one more section to a rod makes it the same length as the next longest rod in the sequence. This is a sensorial/visual presentation so no language is required.

5.  Return rods to the shelf beginning with the shortest rod.

**Presentation II (naming level)**

1. Grade all rods on a rug as in Presentation I. One rug may be used for gathering and grading. 

2. Bring rods 1, 2, and 3 to the bottom of the rug. Leave rods 4 – 10 in a stair arrangement on the top half of the rug.

3. (First period of a three-period lesson) Pick up the smallest rod. Touch the section as you say, “One.” “One. This is one.”  Pick up the second rod. Touch the red section as you say, “One” and touch the blue section as you say, “Two.” “One. Two. This is two.”  Pick up the third rod. Touch the red section as you say, “One.” and touch the blue section as you say, “Two.” and touch the red section as you say, “Three.”  “One. Two. Three. This is three.”  

**NOTE:** When touching the section to count it, use the entire hand to indicate that you are touching the whole segment. You may even grasp it, wrapping fingers around the section of the rod, to create emphasis.

4. (Second period of a three-period lesson) “Show me three.”  “Show me two.”  “Show me one.”  Continue with other variations of the second period. “Give me…”  “Put the…”  “Take the ___ to____.”
5. (Third period of a three-period lesson) “What is this?” “Which rod is this?” “This is?” The child may count the rod’s segments if needed. 

**NOTE:** If the child knows the correct quantity simply by looking at the rod – subitizing – that is good. That is part of developing his/her number sense. DO NOT ask the child to, “Count them to make sure.” This creates doubt in the child’s mind and encourages them to count everything rather than trusting that they can subitize accurately.

6. Continue introducing other rods as the child is ready. Use a three-period lesson to assess. 

**Points of Interest:**
* Similarity to red rods
* Alternating segments of red and blue
* Stair-like progression of rods
* First segment is always red
* Learning that each rod is one piece but represents more than one quantity

**Control of Error:**
* Visual – seeing a rod out of sequence creates disharmony in the design.
* Tactile – touching the rod sections when counting
* Construction – only one of each rod, segments are connected
* Teacher – during three-period lesson

{{< figure class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/math/intro-num/image004.webp" alt="Red Blue Number Rods" caption="Extension 1" >}}

**Variations:**
1. Build the rods vertically, flat on the rug OR vertically stacked one on top of the other.

2.  Show the relationship between the “one” rod and each of the others by using the “one” rod for counting segments in the other rods.
3.   Build a pyramid by centering the rods as they are stacked one on top of the other.

**Extensions:**

{{< figure class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/math/intro-num/image005.webp" alt="Red Blue Number Rods" caption="Combinations to make 10" >}}

1.  Put two rods together to make combinations of 10.
	* Do not use the vocabulary “ plus, equals“ etc. Rather, “How can we make 10? “

2.  Memory challenge:  Place rods on one rug. Go with the child to another rug in a separate area of the room. Ask the child to bring you the “five” rod, the “ten” rod, etc.

{{< figure class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/math/intro-num/image006.webp" alt="Red Blue Number Rods" caption="Nine and one together make ten" >}}

3.  Memory challenge:  Choose a rod, take it to the empty rug, and count the rod. Ask the child to go to the other rug and bring back the rod that is one more or one less.

4.  Introduce concepts of “greater than,” “less than,” and “equal to,” using rods or combinations of rods.  

5.  Show subsets of nine, eight, etc.

6.  Place rods (1-5 to start) on a rug in order. Place a basket with glass “stones” across the room. The child stands near the basket of stones. Teacher holds up a rod and says, “Bring me this many glass stones.”  Child practices recalling the “count” for the rod and then counts out that many stones.  Does the child subitize or need to return to count the rod?

**Vocabulary:**
Red and blue rods, names of numerals

### Sandpaper Numerals

{{< figure class="float-right preview-md" src="/img/math/intro-num/image007.webp" alt="Sandpaper Numerals" caption="Smaller/ narrower version of the Sandpaper Numerals" >}}

**Numeral:** A numeral is a figure, symbol, or group of figures or symbols denoting a number.

**Materials:**
Ten rough sandpaper numerals (0-9) mounted on ten separate smooth green boards. Green is the color of units in a Montessori classroom.

**Prerequisites:**
Some knowledge of number names, coordination, practice with sensorial tactile materials, and experience with the red and blue rods. Child does not need to know quantities to ten to begin work with sandpaper numerals.

**Direct Aim:**
* To trace numerals in the direction the numeral is formed
{{< figure class="float-right preview-md" src="/img/math/intro-num/image008.webp" alt="Sandpaper Numerals" caption="Larger/ wider version of Sandpaper Numerals with space for hand placement on either side" >}}
* To learn the name of the numerals
* Preparation for associating numeral symbols with quantity
* Preparation for abstraction


**Indirect Aim:**
* To prepare for writing numerals
* To prepare for associating numeral with quantity

**Age:** 2.5 – 4 years

**Presentations:**
This work should be done at a table after child washes his/her hands. This will help sensitize fingertips and keep the material clean. It is not necessary to present the numerals in order. Often, it works well to first present the numeral that corresponds with the child’s age. 
Do not start with zero.

**Presentation I**
{{< figure class="float-right preview-md" src="/img/math/intro-num/image009.webp" alt="Sandpaper Numerals" caption="www.montessorialbum.com" >}}

**Introduction**
1.  Take out two (or three if one of the numbers is known) of the  Sandpaper numerals . Place them face up in front of the child. The box of remaining numerals should be placed at the top corner of the table on the teacher’s side of the table. You may even want to turn it around to further isolate attention on the two numerals being considered.

2.  Place the two targeted sandpaper numerals near the top of the table. Move one numeral closer to you. Turn the other number over and push it to the top edge of the table. This will make it clear that, “We will start with this one.”

3.  Place your subdominant hand on the smooth part of the board. Do this slowly and deliberately to encourage child to notice hand placement is important. Then, silently trace the sandpaper numeral with the first two fingers of your dominant hand in the direction the numeral is written. Placing this hand’s two fingers should also be done slowly and deliberately – and lightly.  Then, trace it two more times, saying the numeral’s name as you trace it. “Two.”  “Two.”

4.  Move the numeral card toward the student. “Now, it is your turn.”  Allow the child to trace the numeral and say the name. When finished, place the card at the top of the table – turn it over.

{{< figure class="float-right preview-md" src="/img/math/intro-num/image010.webp" alt="Sandpaper Numerals" caption="Two fingers lightly trace the numeral" >}}

5.  Select the other numeral card and repeat the steps in 3 and 4 above.

6.  Take both number cards and place them in front of the child. Complete the second period of the three-period lesson. “Point to two.”  “Point to four.”  “Trace four.”  “Trace two.”  Etc.  

7.  Complete the third period of the three-period lesson. “What is this?”  “What is this?”  “Tell ___ the name of this numeral.”  “Tell ___ the name of this numeral.” Etc.

8.  Place the numerals back in the box. Show how it is done carefully so the sandpaper isn’t rubbed off.  

**Presentation II**\
Remember, zero is the last numeral presented, and the child should receive the first lesson of the spindle box first, before the zero is introduced with the sandpaper numerals. The spindle box introduces the concept, “Zero means something but it gets nothing.”  “Zero is an empty set.”

Use the same lesson used to introduce numerals but begin with a review of all numerals that have been introduced. This way, if the child has forgotten an introduced number, that number can be re-presented, along with a new numeral. Typically, a presentation focuses on two numerals at a time, one known and one unknown OR two unknowns. 

**Points of Interest:**
* Similarity to sandpaper letters
* Sensitizing fingertips
* Feeling the sandpaper
* Seeing a symbol the child knows
* Learning number names

**Control of Error:**
* Difference between rough and smooth areas
* Three-period lesson
* Muscle memory

{{< figure class="float-right preview-md" src="/img/math/intro-num/image011.webp" alt="Sandpaper Numerals" caption="Extension with cornmeal on a tray http://tothelessonblogspot.com" >}}

**Variations:**
1.  Match cut-out (felt) numerals to the sandpaper numerals.

2.  Match sandpaper numerals to numerals printed on wooden tablets.

3.  Arrange the sandpaper numerals in left-to-right sequence as the teacher says the names in sequence.

4.  Turn the numerals face down. Play “Knock. Knock.” (child raps on numeral card) “Who’s there?” (teacher asks). Then, the child turns over the numeral card and announces the name, “It’s 3!”

5.  “Concentration” game using two sets of numeral cards

{{< figure class="float-right preview-md" src="/img/math/intro-num/image012.webp" alt="Sandpaper Numerals" caption="Extension with chalkboard www.playhood.worldperess.com" >}}

**Extensions:**
1.  Associating quantity with symbol (number rods, loose objects)
2.  Tracing sandpaper numeral card and then tracing numeral in a sand tray.
3.  Writing numeral on chalk board.
4.  Tracing numeral on grooved board.

**Vocabulary:**
Names of numerals

### Number Rods and Numerals

**Materials:**
Red & Blue Rods (1-10) and wooden numeral cards (1-10)

**Prerequisites:**
Experience with sandpaper numerals-recognize numerals, experience ordering the red & blue rods, coordination/balance

**Direct Aim:**
* associate quantities with numeric symbols
* understand the sequence of numbers
* prepare for abstraction

**Indirect Aim:**
* practice one-to-one counting
* prepare for decimal system operations
* develop sense of accuracy, order, and concentration

**Age:**  3.5 – 4 years or whenever the child knows some of the number rods and the corresponding sandpaper numbers such as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

**Presentation:**

{{< figure class="preview-md float-right pure-img" src="/img/math/intro-num/image015.webp" alt="Number Rods" caption="Presentation 1: number cards placed randomly at the bottom of the rug" >}}

**NOTE:** In this lesson, the quantity is fixed and the symbols are loose. In contrast, the upcoming spindle box lesson provides loose quantity and fixed symbols. The cards and counters lesson, presented after the spindle box, offers loose quantity and loose objects. This presentation is done on a rug.  Make sure the rug is wide enough to accommodate the 10 rod.  It should not hang off the side of the rug.  The rug also needs to be deep enough to accommodate the rods and all the wooden cards when they are removed from the box and placed, “in random order at the bottom of the rug.”

**Presentation I**
1.  Place number rods randomly on a rug.  

2.  Order the rods as done in the initial red & blue rod lesson.  Place the longest rod at the top of the rug with the red section touching the left side of the rug. Rods should be touching – tight.

3.  Place number cards randomly on the bottom half of the rug.

4.  Optional Assessment Step: Order the number cards.  Say the name of the numeral as it is placed along the bottom of the rug, left to right, starting with one. Leave a space between cards.

5.  Begin corresponding quantity and symbol.  

6.  Place flat hand on top of the “one” rod and say, “One.”  Then, turn to the child and say, “Please give me the one.”  Show the child how to place the “one” card so it leans against the “one” rod. (If it keeps slipping, simply lay it flat on the rug, directly under and touching the last section of the rod. Choose different rug next time. Don’t allow slipping card to become focus of the lesson.)

7.  Repeat the steps in 6 above for the “two” rod and number card, and the “three” rod and number card and so on. Be slow and deliberate when placing the card at the edge of the number rod.

{{< img class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/math/intro-num/image016.webp" alt="Number Rods" >}}

8.  When you reach the “ten” rod, turn to the child and say, “Now it’s your turn! Let’s switch. Now you count the rods and place the numbers.”  Collect the numbers and place them at the bottom of the rug. Slide the rods back to the original position toward the top of the rug.

9.  When finished, review the numeral names as they are placed in the box. (Could ask child to: “Put the 6 in the box. Put the 8 in the box.” and so on.)

**Points of Interest:**
* combining two familiar works
* grading rods
* associating the numeral card with the rod

**Control of Error:**
* visual – seeing stair arrangement of rods when ordered correctly
* counting and child’s knowledge of numerals from sandpaper numeral work
* teacher

{{< figure class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/math/intro-num/image017.webp" alt="Number Rods" caption="Variation 1-5" >}}

**Variations:**
1.  Show the numeral first, then have child fetch the corresponding rod.

2.  Place rods on one rug, numerals on another. Then ask child to order rods & numeral cards on a third rug. Teacher could be at the third rug, “Bring me the three rod, then the numeral three.”

3.  Always bring all rods to a rug.  As a variation, the subsequent ordering and corresponding activities (which take place on a nearby rug) could be done with only the first five rods.

{{< img class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/math/intro-num/image018.webp" alt="Number Rods" >}}

4.  When the ordering is complete, ask the child to wear a blindfold. Remove a rod, a numeral card, or both.  Ask the child to “Open your eyes and tell me what is missing.”

**Extensions:**
1.  Match colored bead bars to correct rod and numeral.
2.  Place numeral cards around the classroom. Point to a rod and ask the child to find the corresponding numeral card. (More than one child can play this game.)
3.  Build combinations of ten – bring the numbers along.  This is the beginning of addition. “9 and 1 joined together is the same as 10.”  “8 and 2 joined together is the same as 10.”
4.  Use table-top red and blue rods.
5.  Rod sheet – color red/blue pattern and practice writing the numerals.

**Vocabulary:**
names of numeral cards and names of rods

### Spindle Boxes

**Materials:** Two boxes with compartments labeled 0-4 and 5-9, 45 spindles, container(s) for spindles. The spindles may all be in one container, or two containers could be used – one with 10 spindles for the 0-4 box and one with 35 spindles for the 5-9 box. 

**Prerequisites:**
* knowledge of quantity and numerals 0-4, and then 5-9, then 0-9
* experience with red and blue rods, sandpaper numerals, and associating the rods and numerals

**Direct Aim:**
* learning the concept of zero
* practice accurately counting out a specific quantity of objects
* association of a numeral (the symbol) with a quantity

**Indirect Aim:**
* preparation for number-numeral concept of larger quantities
* preparation for abstraction

**Age:**  3-4 years

**Presentation:**\
This work is done at a table. The container(s) for the spindles should be designed in a way to not tip over easily and to display the spindles in a way that is easy to pick them up. A shallow basket works well. Begin with “1” and introduce “0” last.

**Presentation I**

{{< img class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/math/intro-num/image019.webp" alt="Child working with Spindle Boxes" >}}

1.  Use spindle box one (0-4) and a container of 10 spindles

2.  Point to numeral 1 and say, “One.”

3.  Pick up one spindle from source container, with dominant hand, and place it in subdominant hand. “One.” Wrap fingers around spindle as you say this.

4.  Then, count it into the 1 numeral compartment while saying, “One.”

5.  Point to numeral 2 and say, “Two.”

6.  Count two spindles into your subdominant hand, one at a time, “One. Two.” Grasp the two spindles in the subdominant hand and say, “Two.”

7.  Then, count the two spindles, one at a time, into the numeral 2 compartment.

8.  Continue with three and four.  Point. Count into hand. Grasp and say number. Count one at a time into compartment and say number.

9.  Show the child the empty source container. Then, point to the zero and say, “Zero.”

10.  Point to the empty compartment and say, “Zero gets nothing.  Zero is the empty set.”

{{< figure class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/math/intro-num/image020.webp" alt="Spindle Boxes" caption="In Psychoarithmetic, Montessori describes “two boxes” for this material and she suggests flat sided spindles that will not roll of the table." >}}

11.  To return the material to the shelf, the child may count spindles, from one compartment at a time, into the source container. Or, simply pick up the spindles and place them in the container. (No dumping/pouring spindles into the container.)

**Presentation II**
1.  Use spindle box one with the container of 10 spindles and spindle box two with the container of 35 spindles.

2.  Repeat the steps in Presentation I for all of the numerals, beginning with 1. Zero is still last because it connects to the empty source container.

3.  As the child counts 7, 8, and 9 spindles into his/her subdominant hand, the quantity may become challenging to hold. (Experiencing the quantity getting bigger and bigger is good, “Wow! Nine is a lot!”) Demonstrate, with emphasis, that the subdominant hand can be held flat and this allows the spindles to be stacked more easily.

**Points of Interest:**
* Reading numerals on compartments
* Identifying quantity and symbol
* Seeing no spindles in “0” compartment
* Shape/smoothness/clicking sound of spindles
* Quantity gets hard to hold as it increases

**Control of Error:**
* exact number of spindles are available for compartments
* numerals are in a fixed sequence
* counting experience with first box
* the child’s experience and success with previous math materials
* the teacher’s awareness of the child’s readiness

**Variations:**
* other objects 
* activities with a fixed number line
* activities with a fixed number line and loose quantity

**Extensions:**
numeral cards and counters (loose symbols & loose quantity)

**Vocabulary:**
* zero
* spindles

### Numerals and Counters

{{< img class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/math/intro-num/image021.webp" alt="Counting Beads on Rug" >}}

**Materials:**
55 glass stones (or smooth river stones) in an attractive container and 11 folded numeral cards or wooden number cards (0-10) in an attractive container, tray to hold materials

**Prerequisites:**
* spindle boxes 
* number rods and numeral cards

**Direct Aim:**
* associate quantity with its symbol, 0-10
* review the concept of zero
* reinforce the concept of sets
* practice counting a loose quantity

**Indirect Aim:**
develop accuracy and concentration

**Age:**  3.5 - 4

**Presentation:**
This lesson calls on the child to recognize the numeral and retrieve an accurate number of stones.  The stones’ container is placed on the rug but could be placed in the room somewhere if the teacher wants to add the opportunity for movement. This work would typically come after the spindle box lesson. This work may involve two or three children if each child has had an individual lesson prior to the group activity.

**Presentation I**
1.  Place the container of stones in the upper right corner of the rug. Place the numeral cards on the rug randomly (placed face down is a possibility) below the container of stones.

2.  Select one of the cards, look at it, and say the name of the numeral. “Three!” Place the card in the upper left corner of the rug with the numeral visible.

3.  Say, “Three!” as you move your hand to the container of stones. Count three stones into your subdominant hand, one at a time, saying, “One. Two. Three.”

4.  Place the stones below the numeral card in a column as you count stones from your hand, “One. Two. Three.”  This creates a “set of three” and stones do not need to be arranged in a particular way.

5.  Invite the child to choose a card, “Now it is your turn.”  (If the child knows only certain numerals, find those cards and place them in front of the child. “You can work with these cards today.”  Then, return the other cards to the container. You may also return the unneeded stones to the container.

**Points of Interest:**
* work feels like a game
* beauty of the stones or other objects
* opportunity to count
* seeing the objects form a set for each numeral

**Control of Error:**
visual – the exact number of stones are provided so there should be none leftover and each numeral card, except zero, should have stones.

**Variations:**
Use other natural objects such as seashells, acorns, pinecones, etc.

**Extensions:**
* numerals and counters
* number line

**Vocabulary:**
names of numerals

### Numeral Line 

**Materials:**
Number cards (0-9) and a strip of fabric long enough to accommodate the cards.  A plain, smooth table runner works well.

**Prerequisites:** Spindle Box, Sandpaper Numerals

**Direct Aim:** To match numerals to their corresponding place on the number line

**Indirect Aim:** To reinforce linear counting

**Age:** 3.5-4

**Presentation:**
1. Show child where the number line is kept
2. Set up number line, unrolling it in the same way the rugs are unrolled
3. Bring the basket of numerals to the numeral line
4. Beginning with the numeral one, point to the numeral and say, “One.”  
5. Look through the basket of numerals, saying, “I’m looking for one.”
6. Place the numeral one on top of the 1 on the numeral line.  
7. Now, point to the numeral two and say, “Two.”  
8. Look through the basket of numerals, saying, “I’m looking for two.”  
9. Place the numeral two on top of the 2 on the numeral line.  
10. Repeat the above steps all the way through ten
11. Point to the numeral 0 and say “Zero.”  
12. Look through the basket of numerals, saying, “I’m looking for 0.”  “0 is a number that means none, and it’s a really important numeral…you’ll see.”
13. Beginning with the numeral 1, start placing the numerals back into the basket.  Place 0 in the basket last.
14. Roll up the numeral line in the same way you roll up the rugs.
15. Restore the numeral line and basket of numerals to their place on the shelf.

**Points of Interest:**
* This work is similar to the work with the alphabet role
* The wooden numerals are attractive
* Matching the numeral to its place on the numeral role

**Control of Error:**

**Variations:** Once students have had enough practice matching the wooden numerals to their place on the numeral line, you can give them a blank numeral line to place the wooden numerals on.

**Extensions:** Eventually, after students have had numeral and counter lessons, you can provide gems/shells to place the corresponding number of inside the outline of the numerals on the numeral line.  (Provide a control chart for them to check their work, or a book with one page for each numeral for them to check their work with).  

**Vocabulary:** Numeral line

### Cards and Counters

“The exercise consists first of all in placing the cards, which have been shuffled, in sequence and then placing under each number card the corresponding number of objects. This exercise is a test to verify what learning has actually taken place, that is to say, whether the numbers are known in their correct sequence together with the quantities they represent. To bring a new concept within the child’s comprehension, he should be asked to place the objects two-by-two: this can only be done with even numbers, whereas with odd numbers one object is left unmatched, and in this way the children instinctively grasp the notion of odd and even numbers and the difference between them.” Maria Montessori, Psychoarithmetic: Arithmetic developed under the guidelines outlined by child psychology (p 10-11)

**Materials:**
* Set of numerals, 0-9, and 45 counters 
* Note: Many environments use variation of 1-10, 1-9, or 0-10. Maria Montessori described using 0-9 on page 10 of Psychoarithmetic: Arithmetic developed under the guidelines outlined by child psychology. Zero should be included.

**Prerequisites:**
Red and blue rods, numeral cards, red and blue rods with numeral cards, spindle boxes


**Direct Aim:**\
Assess child’s learning after foundation lessons. Verify child can:
- sequence numerals correctly
- use correct name for the symbol
- assign correct quantity to each numeral

Introduce the new concept of odd and even numbers (“Even. Not Even.” then “Even. Odd.”)

**Indirect Aim:**
* preparation for number/numeral concept of larger quantities
* preparation for abstraction 

**Age:** 3.5 - 4.5 for Presentation I and 5 - 5.5 for Presentation II (odd and even)

**Presentation I:**
1.  Place the numeral cards randomly along the bottom edge of the rug, face up.

2.  Choose the “0” card and place it on the left side of the rug, almost in the upper left corner. Touch the card and say, “Zero.” Then, touch the empty spot next to it and say, “One.”

3.  Choose the “1” card and place it next to the “0” card. Leave a space between the cards. Touch the “1” card and say, “One.”  Then, touch the empty spot next to it and say, “Two.”

4.  Choose the “2” card. Continue with all the other cards to demonstrate how the work is done. (Or, move straight to assessment purpose of the lesson and invite the child to complete the numeral card sequencing).

5.  After cards are sequenced, turn attention to the counters.  “Now, we are ready for the counters.” (OR, before this step, verify the child’s knowledge of the numeral names by completing step three of the three period lesson.)

6.  The counters are placed two-by-two (left, then right) to create pairs. Point to “0” and say, “Zero. Zero gets nothing.” Point to the empty space under the “0” and say, “Zero is the empty set.”

7.  Point to/touch the “1,” then pick up one counter and place it in the subdominant hand while saying, “One.”  Then, take it out of the subdominant hand with the dominant hand and place it under the “1” card toward the bottom edge, left side. (This is the same rhythm as the spindle box lesson.)

8.  Demonstrate 2, 3, and 4 so the child can see that if the counter is not part of a pair, then it is placed at the center in its row.

**Presentation II**
1.  After the above total layout is concluded, with one finger, point to the “1” counter and say, “This is a set of one.”

2.  With two fingers, point to the “2” counters and say, “This is a set of two.”

3.  With one finger, point to the unpaired counter of “3” and say, “Here is another set of one.”  “If a number has a set of one at the bottom, we call it odd.” 

4.  So the child other odd numbers. “1 is odd, 3 is odd, 5 is odd, 7 is odd, and 9 is odd.”

5.  “The other numbers with sets of 2 are even.”

6.  “2 is even, 4 is even, 6 is even, 8 is even, and 10 is even.”

7.  Do a three period lesson to assess student understanding.

**Points of Interest:**
* placing the numbers in sequence
* making a systematic array of counters
* seeing odd and even quantities/numbers (Presentation II)
* counters paired to get idea of set
* seeing odd counter in the middle

**Control of Error:**
* number of counters
* the ordered placement of counters makes it possible to determine if amount is correct – the array increases

**Variations:**
* Arrange counters in a simple column under the numeral card – for very young children.
* Glass stones or other objects instead of plastic counters.
* Child wears a blindfold, something is removed, and then the child identifies what is missing.

**Extensions:**
* Memory game 
* Written activity – child writes numbers and then draws circles to represent counters 

**Vocabulary:**
counters, names of numbers 0-9, set, odd and even

### Memory Game

(TEP students will complete this lesson with sequential photos after gathering/creating listed materials.)

**Materials:**
* Folded slips of paper labeled 0-10 in a container, a container of 55 objects, a box to fetch quantities of objects, a placemat-sized rug on which to place the container of 55 objects.
* Objects should be given careful consideration so as not to detract from the purpose of the work. 

**Prerequisites:**
* knowledge of numerals
* ability to associate numeral and quantity
* ability to count to 10 accurately
* understanding that zero is the empty set – zero gets nothing

**Direct Aim:**
* testing ability to associate quantities with numerals
* further practice counting out a specific number of objects – for younger children

**Indirect Aim:**
* develop capacity for memory retention of a quantity
* preparation for abstraction

**Age:** 3-4 years

**Presentation:**\
This work provides the teacher another opportunity to assess learning; numeral names, one-to-one counting accuracy, quantity and numeral association, ability to remember a number over a period of time. This final skill will be required during the study of the decimal system.  

1. Invite a small group of children (2-3) to a rug.  The work rug should display a tray with a container of eleven folded slips of laminated paper (0-10), a container of 55 objects, a small box that is large enough to hide one of the numeral slips, one carrying container (another box), and a placemat-sized rug.

2.  “We are going to play a memory game.  You need to know how to keep your number secret when it is your turn. Can you do that?”  “Okay, first we need to place this container of objects somewhere in the classroom.”  Ask a child to take the placemat-sized rug and put it somewhere in the classroom.  Ask a different child to place the container of objects on that small rug.

3.  “Now, I will show you how the game is played. Watch.”  “First, choose a numeral slip from the basket.”  Move the basket so it is in front of you. Choose a numeral slip, cup it in your hand and look at the number. Fold the slip and place it in the small box. “I will hide the numeral here. The numeral is my secret.”

4.  “I am keeping my numeral a secret.”  “I can remember it even when I don’t see it!”

5.  Pick up the carrying container – something with a lid. “I am going to go get a set of objects.”  “My secret numeral tells me how many to get!”

6.  Walk to the object basket on the small rug. Place the correct number of objects in the carrying container, one at a time, and return to the work rug with the objects.

7.   “Can you guess my secret numeral?”  “Can you guess how many I have?” Let all the children guess a quantity.

8.  Then, pour the objects out of the container, onto the rug in front of you.  Retrieve your numeral slip hidden in the small box and hold it up for the children to see. “Four is my secret! Four is my secret numeral.”  

9.  Place the numeral slip on the rug and count the objects into an array like cards and counters.

10.  Then, invite a child to choose a secret numeral.

**Points of Interest:**
* social aspect of a group game
* keeping a secret
* counting objects and verifying with numeral slip
* texture, color, interesting characteristic of objects

**Control of Error:**
* exact number of objects available
* child’s counting accuracy
* readiness for the Memory Game

**Variations:**
Progress through game as a group: phase one, all children gather objects, in turn, and hide them under the rug in front of them along with the numeral slip. Then, in phase 2, children reveal numerals and count objects, in turn.

Set up as a two-person work.  Each child has a container for collecting objects. The other steps are same as given in initial presentation.

Teacher whispers a gathering command with multiple objects as possibilities, such as, “Bring me seven pennies.”  “Bring me four quarters.”   “Bring me five dimes.”  Then, the set is placed by the corresponding numeral slip.

**Extensions:**
* Decimal system work such as number building and 45 layout
* Operations work – accurate counting/fetching

**Vocabulary:**
* names of numerals/quantities
* For older children, this game could also be used to introduce the word, “estimate” if a child’s collected objects are displayed briefly before the box lid is closed again.
