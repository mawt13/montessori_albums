## Introduction to Zoology

Schematics and Important Distinctions

A whole branch of science, called Taxonomy, is involved with classifying and grouping living things. Carl Linnaeus, an 18th Century Swedish botanist and zoologist, is known as the ‘Father of Taxonomy’. He invented a system of classifying living things. Many of his principles are still in use today. Traditionally, animals were classified according to their physical characteristics. For example, if an animal has four legs, is cold-blooded, has scales, and lays eggs, then it is a reptile. 

Grouping animals according to their physical characteristics alone – while still important – is no longer considered the most accurate classification model.  The current accepted system of grouping animals (any organism) is based on its evolutionary history. Animals with a common ancestor are grouped together. This approach is called phylogenetics.

The original two-kingdoms (plant/animal) model for classifying organisms was eventually updated to the five kingdoms model (Prokaryote, Protista, Fungi, Plant, Animal), but this model too is now obsolete. One visual for the current classification system is the Tree of Life. This represents the three domains, including the three valid kingdoms, with each branch representing a lineage descended from a common ancestor.  The Tree of Life demonstrates that all organisms arose from what can be called “first life”, although it is likely that life developed from several sources.

{{< img class="pure-img white-outline" src="/img/culture/zoo/image005.webp" alt="two-kingdom chart" >}}

The Five Kingdoms model is now obsolete (including the term 'monera'). Organisms are now grouped into three domains: Domain Bacteria, Domain Archaea, and Domain Eukarya, which includes the protists (but protist is not a kingdom), the fungi kingdom, the plant kingdom, and the animal kingdom--so three domains, three kingdoms, with one domain (eukaryote) containing one group (protists) and three kingdoms.  
Dr. Pricilla Spears suggests that for young children, you can use a three -kingdom  approach (fungi, plant, and animal are considered "valid" kingdoms) and, for discussion's sake, group the prokaryotes (which include bacteria and archaea) and protists together. Domains can be presented when the child is able to comprehend more abstract ideas.

**Prokaryotes (formerly “Kingdom Monera”)**\
Prokaryotic cells do not contain a nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelle. Their genetic material is scattered throughout the cell. Bacteria and archaea make up the prokaryotes. Prokaryote means “before the nucleus.”     

Prokaryotes have two distinct branches—Domains Archaea and Bacteria, which did not likely share a common ancestor (Spears, 2016). Bacteria includes oxygen producers, nitrogen fixers, pathogens, fermenters, and decomposers. Some archaea are “extremophiles,” thriving in extreme environments like salt and heat; others live in more normal conditions, like people's mouths and in the soil. Individuals are single-celled, may or may not move, most have a cell wall, have no chloroplasts or other organelles, and have no membrane-bound nucleus. Prokaryotes are microscopic, although one type, namely the blue-green bacteria (cyanobacteria), look like algae when congregated in large colonies. They are filamentous and quite long, green, but have no visible structure inside the cells. Other prokaryotes also grow in filaments or clumps. They absorb nutrients through the cell wall or produce their own by photosynthesis or by using energy from minerals.

**Eukaryotes**\
Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles, including a nucleus. Eukaryotes can be single-celled (some protists) or multi-celled plants, fungi, and animals. Eukaryote means “true nucleus.”

**The Protists (formerly “Kingdom Protista”)**\
Protists can be single-celled or multi-celled, and many move by cilia, flagella, or by amoeboid mechanisms. There is usually no cell wall, although some forms may have a cell wall. They have organelles including a nucleus and may have chloroplasts, so some will be green.  Most are very small, although many are big enough to be recognized in a dissecting microscope or even with a magnifying glass. Some, like giant kelp, are quite large. Nutrients are acquired by photosynthesis, ingestion of other organisms, or both. Some protists  are parasites and feed from the living body of their host organism. Common examples of protists are protazoa, algae and seaweed, amoeba, and diatoms.

**The Fungus Kingdom or Kingdom Fungi**\
Fungi are multicellular eukaryotic organisms, with a cell wall, organelles including a nucleus, but no chloroplasts; they are heterotrophic, using food made by other organisms. Many are decomposers and some are parasites. They have no mechanisms for locomotion. Fungi range in size from microscopic to very large (such as mushrooms). Nutrients are acquired by absorption. For the most part, fungi acquire nutrients from decaying material. Common examples are mushrooms, molds, mildews, and yeast.

**The Plant Kingdom or Kingdom Plantae**\
Plants are multicellular eukaryotes and while they do literally move, they do not move in the sense of displacement in space as do animals. Although gametes of some plants move using cilia or flagella. Organelles including nucleus, chloroplasts are present, and cell walls containing cellulose are present. Most have a root system and a shoot system. They are autotrophs and use chlorophyll for photosynthesis to acquire nutrients.

**The Animal Kingdom or Kingdom Animalia**\
Animals include all organisms that are multicellular eukaryotes without cell walls.  They have groups of cells (tissues), each with a specialized function. Most animals are mobile and move with the aid of appendages like legs or wings, cilia, or flagella.  Their cells contain organelles including a nucleus, but no chloroplasts or cell walls. Animals are heterotrophs and acquire nutrients through ingestion of sources from the outside environment.

### VERTEBRATES AND INVERTEBRATES{.redc}

[the vertebrate/ invertebrate distinction (which is usually considered an outdated term)  works here because the examples are actual vertebrates]

We no longer use the vertebrate/invertebrate distinction. Chordates get broken down into lancelets, tunicates and vertebrates. Per Dr. Priscilla Spears, “Chordates are not the same as vertebrates.” (The lancelets and tunicates have a cord, but not a completely developed vertebral column—the true distinction is chordate invertebrate (lancelets and tunicates); chordate vertebrate (see five groups below); and invertebrate (worms, sponges, arthropods, etc.) Priscilla notes that many Montessori materials mistakenly equate chordate and vertebrates. She also notes: “If you find the term 'non-chordate' in your materials, it would be best to change it to 'invertebrate.'”  Vertebrates still include the five groups below.

**Materials:**
* Snail (live if possible) or earthworm (live if possible)
* A live vertebrate for example, human fish, cat etc.
* Plastic mat

**Prerequisites:**\
Any basic classification work (for example, magnetic/ non-magnetic)

**Direct Aim:**\
Learn the two main branches of Animalia: vertebrates and invertebrates

**Indirect Aims:**\
Prepare for all remaining Zoology lessons

**Age:** 3-5

**Presentation:**
1. Gather the students (small group or the whole class) around a low table.
2. Bring out the invertebrate and let it move across the table mat.
3. Ask the children if they see any legs or arms on the snail or worm. Ask them to look at their arms legs; ask them if there are bones inside of our arms and legs. Ask them if they have ever seen someone in a cast or on crutches from a broken bone.\
Elicit discussions of why they think the snail or the worm doesn’t have bones.
4. Bring the vertebrate to the low table. Talk about the bones that this animal has. Point out the various bones.
5. Tell the children that animals that have bones have one very special bone- the backbone. Show the backbone on the specimen vertebrate. Encourage the children to reach back on their own bodies and feel their backbone as it enters the base of their skull.\
Optional: picture of a human skeleton. These can be used to show the backbone in a human.
6. Do a recapitulation of the scientific facts about invertebrates and vertebrates

{{< pure_table

### THE FISH

#### THE FISH: Specimen{.redc}

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/zoo/image016.webp" alt="Fish on Tray" >}}

**Materials:**
* Either a real dead but fresh fish (from a fish market without the innards but with both the head and backbone). You can ask for the fish to sliced open to show the backbone but not removed.
* A live fish (pet)
* Plastic mat

**Prerequisites:**
* Classification lessons on animal/plant/other 
* (Optional)botany lessons with real specimens

**Direct Aim:**
* See a real specimen of an invertebrate
* Learn the characteristics of a fish

**Indirect Aims:**
* Prepare for learning the parts and functions of the fish
* Prepare for other zoology specimen lessons
* Prepare for the fish puzzle lesson

**Age:** 3-6

**Presentation:** (Specimen lessons are often done with groups of children or the whole class) 
1. Bring the gutted fresh fish to a low table on a plastic mat
2. Tell the children that life first started on earth in the waters. Over 530 million years ago, Fish evolved. Living things developed a head and backbone. Fish are among the earlier examples of this development.
3. Tell the children that by looking at this real specimen we are going to learn the characteristics of fish.
4. You may begin with the head or the tail, but it is better to go from one end to the other. 
5. Head: point to the head of the fish. Engage the children to name and describe what they see. They may touch and smell the fish. The parts of the head are: the head, the eyes, the mouth. The size of the mouth of a fish is a clue to what it eats; the larger the mouth the more they eat other whole fish or animals. The eyes of fish are always open- even when they sleep. The are large since it is dark under water and they are mostly nocturnal and need to see their prey. Fish eyes have no eyelids. Fish do have nostril and can smell; they have a very good sense of smell. Help the children describe the head parts: cold, still, shiny, smooth, gray, white, brown, black, hard, stiff etc.
6. Gills: Proceed to the next part of the fish - the gills which are located just behind the head. 
Definition of gills: A gill is the body part that helps a fish breathe underwater. In fish and other aquatic creatures, their gills are equivalent to our lungs. Fish and some amphibians need to breathe the oxygen in water to live, and they use their gills for this. https://www.vocabulary.com

FYI: Function of the gills: Gills are feathery organs full of blood vessels. A fish breathes by taking water into its mouth and forcing it out through the gill passages. As water passes over the thin walls of the gills, dissolved oxygen moves into the blood and travels to the fish's cells.

Optional: Review what a living organism needs: water, to breathes and to eat. See lesson living and non-living. Review how a plant “breathes” and “eats”. Plants are autotrophs making their own food. Plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen to the air during their process of making food, photosynthesis. Review how humans breathe and eat. 
The fish, like humans are heterotrophs and take in food from the environment. 

{{< img class="white-outline float-right" src="/img/culture/zoo/image018.webp" alt="Fish Closeup" >}}

Fish breath oxygen like humans too, but they take in oxygen but from water, not from the air. They take in water that has oxygen in their mouth and push it out through their gills. Humans take in oxygen through our mouth and /or nose and breath it out through the same orifices. 

Lift the gill to expose the feathery, red part of the inner gill. Explain that the gills open and close. The gills are red because there are many blood vessels in the gills. The oxygen from the water goes from the water straight to the blood vessels.  Engage the children in description of the gills: flexible, opening and closing like a door, a creative way to breathe. 

{{< img class="white-outline float-right" src="/img/culture/zoo/image020.webp" alt="Fish Gills Closeup" >}}

7. Body and scales: Invite the children to touch and brush the scales in different directions. Some scales will come off. These can be passed around, examined and described with the children. The ridges in a scale tell how old the fish is. Scales provide protection and camouflage. The whole fish is also coated with a layer of slime (mucus); that’s why fish are slippery when they are just out of the water. 

8. Lateral line:
Fish have a lateral line system, also known as the lateralis system. It is a system of tactile sense organs, made of very small pores (holes)  located on the head and along both sides of the body. The lateral line helps the fish detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water.
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sensory_Systems/Fish/Lateral_Line

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/zoo/image022.webp" alt="Fish Closeup" >}}

   Point to the lateral line which runs down the sides of the fish. Pick the fish up and find the lateral line on both sides and on the head, of possible.
FYI: the lateral line is not always a straight line; it can arc up towards the top of the fish and then arc back down toward the tail. The shape of the fish influences the lateral line shape. 

9. Fins: four types:  pectoral, dorsal, pelvic and anal
Fins come in lots of shapes and sizes. They are used for swimming and sometimes for protection. They are made of skin with tiny bones or cartilage in. Fins come in lots of shapes and sizes.
Names and functions of parts of a living organism usually come with second and third presentations which usually do not use a real specimen but rather the puzzle or a card work. However, the fin nomenclature is listed here. 
   If you chose to name the fins at this first specimen presentation they are below:\

{{< img class="white-outline float-right w-400" src="/img/culture/zoo/image024.webp" alt="Fish Tails Chart" >}}

Pectoral fins: help the fish move from side-to-side. They are also known as arm fins.\
   Dorsal fin: a spiny, hard fin that helps to keep the fish upright.\
   Pelvic fin: helps the fish to move up, down and turn.\
   Anal fin: located at the back of the body stop the fish from wobbling in the water.

10. Caudal fin: The tail of a fish is also called a fin; the tail. It swings from side to side to move forwards, left and right in the water. Tails tell us a lot about the fish: how fast they swim, where they swim and where they look for food. Sharks are the only fish that cannot swim backwards!
Discuss with the student their observations and interactions with the caudal fin. 

11. Finally, remind the children that a fish is a vertebrate and has a backbone. If the fish has been filleted to allow this, open the fish up to display the backbone. Carefully lift up parts of the back bone and show them the spine. 

{{< img class="white-outline float-right w-400" src="/img/culture/zoo/image026.webp" alt="Fish Cleaning" >}}

**Points of Interest:**
* Real fish
* Similarities of fish and humans: oxygen and eating with the mouth
* Names of the parts of the fish
* The facts about a parts of the fish

**Control of Error:**\
Teacher 

**Variations:**
* Observe a real fish in a bowl or tank. Point out all the parts. 
* Use a sardine as a specimen. They are small, not messy and easy to cut open to remove the backbone.

#### THE FISH: Observation and Care{.redc}

**Observation:**
Having fish in an early childhood classroom is both common and uncomplicated. 
Like all pets, when we take an animal out of its natural environment, we need to commit to support it thereby ensuring it’s safe and healthy life within the living conditions we are putting them in. 
 
A classroom pet can serve for numerous teachable moments in multiple areas of the classroom: Zoology/ Science (observation and recording), Art (drawing), Language (descriptive nouns and adjectives or writing with the moveable alphabet, Practical Life (cleaning, feeding and care).

*Science:* Encourage the children to make observation journals for the living organisms in the classroom, plants and animals.  A “scientist’s journal”, an Observation Journal,” for a  4-6 year old is easy to make and should be kept in the classroom throughout the year(s). Simply stapling together several pages lined paper that has a blank area to draw. As the children near the end of their Children’s house time, they likely will be ready to have an Observation Journal that has on the left-hand page a full page for writing (or transcribing from Movable alphabet work) and on the right-hand side a blank space for drawing and labeling. A diversity of covers can be used for an Observation Journal. This journal work, which should live on the shelf as a work offers a convenient way to monitor the development of: handwriting, written expression, drawing skills, observation skills and changing interests. It is recommended that the filled journals be added to the child’s portfolio and given at the completion of their third year to the family with the other records of the three-year cycle. 

**Care:**\
For most ages, caring for a pet can create helpful and supportive habits for our own wellbeing and happiness. For children, caring for a pet can likewise build habits of responsibility, altruism and inquiry. 

However, care for a pet can also be a test of commitment; thus, part of the power of building a habit. Here are suggestions for having a pet ( fish, bird, mammal, reptile, amphibian).
For working with children (4.5 -6) who want/ have pets:

1. Support them by having an interactive chart
2. Encourage them to learn scientific facts about their pet
3. Encourage them to observe their pet and practice the drawing conclusions based on evidence
4. Help the children understand responsibility of caring for a pet as the counterpart of enjoying its company/having the freedom to have one.
5. Prepare children for a pet’s death but talking about life cycles of all living things, including the species of the pet. In Nurturing the Spirit by Aline Wolf, there is a section on “The Death of a Pet.” She gives suggestions for handling this in a classroom situation.

#### THE FISH: Puzzle of parts with functions{.redc}

**Materials:** 
* Montessori fish puzzle
* Either: premade labels or paper and pencil to write the labels
* Control chart (optional)

**Prerequisites:** 
* Lessons on classification 
* Optional : Botany puzzles 

**Direct Aim:** 
- Identify and name the parts of a fish
- Familiarity with the functions of the parts of the fish

**Indirect Aims:** 
- Preparation for research on an animal
- Preparation for Cosmic education

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right w-400" src="/img/culture/zoo/image032.webp" caption="This is a new Montessori fish puzzle from a supplier in NZ. It has some real advantages over the traditional puzzle: the gill piece and the image of the skeleton underneath. https://www.montessorishop.co.nz/products/htz0172" >}}

**Age:**  4-6 

**Presentation:**\
(Note: Using the control chart can be challenging since there will not be much room to place the labels. However, for a differentiated lesson for a young child or a child with special needs, the control chart may be very helpful). 
1. Bring the fish Puzzle to a table with the child. 
2. Name the lesson: the parts of the fish
 
3. As with the specimen of the fish, begin with one end or the other. We will begin with the head as in the presentation of the specimen.

4. Remove the piece of the head and place it to the right of the puzzle at the top of the table. Do the first period lesson: “this is the head of the fish.” Ask the child what they know about the head of the fish. Recollecting the specimen can help. The parts in the head include : the snout, the mouth, the nostrils, the eyes. Fish do have a sense of hearing too! Though it is no typically on the head. For s description of the senses in a fish: http://www.seagrant.umn.edu/fisheries/senses  Review the roles of the sense for the fish and its survival needs. Write the word “ head”. “ eye”, “mouth” and place them next to the piece for the head.

5. Next, remove the piece of the gill. Place it to the right of the puzzle below the head piece. If the child knows the name, then move directly to writing the word. If the child does not know the name, begin to give its function (See above lesson THE FISH: Specimen #6. Gill). 

6. Remove the pectoral fin and name it, placing it below the other pieces. Write the name and place it to the right as the others. Remind the child that the word “pect” means “breast or chest”  and so it designates the fin just below its head, as our chest is below our head. 

7. Remove the piece of the body which also has the lateral line. Name it as “the body” and slowly trace with the index finger the lateral line from left to right, naming it. Write both words and place them to the right of the puzzle pieces which is placed in the column below the previous pieces. Review the function of the lateral line (See above lesson THE FISH: Specimen #8. Lateral line). 

8. Remove the dorsal fin and place it with the others. Name it and write the word, placing it again in a second column to the right of the puzzle pieces. Tell the child that “dorsal” [dorsum] means “back”. Review the function of the dorsal fin. (See above lesson THE FISH: Specimen #9: Fins: Dorsal). 

9. Remove the pelvic fin and place it with the others. Name it and write the word, placing it again in a second column to the right of the puzzle pieces. Tell the child that “pelvis” means “basin/ tub” – like a “tummy cavity” that hold something- food and babies!  Review the function of the pelvic fin. (See above lesson THE FISH: Specimen #9: Fins: Pelvis).

10. Remove the anal fin and place it with the others. Name it and write the word, placing it again in a second column to the right of the puzzle pieces. Tell the child that “anus” refers to where the fish excretes waste/ goes the bathroom! The fin is close to there and therefore has a similar name. Review the function of the pelvic fin. (See above lesson THE FISH: Specimen #9: Fins: Anal).

11. Remove the caudal fin (tail) and place it with the others. Name it and write the word, placing it again in a second column to the right of the puzzle pieces. Tell the child that “cauda” means “tail” and that scientists often use Latin words for naming parts of living and non-living things. Review the function of the caudal fin. (See above lesson THE FISH: Specimen #10: Caudal fin).

12. Invite the child to play games to practice the names. Perhaps, bring all the fins (including the caudal fin) together play a mystery definition game. For example, “I am the fin that sits up on top of the fish’s back and I help keep it upright. My name begins with a /d/ and my name means “back.” 

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/zoo/image034.webp" alt="Fish Embroidery" >}}

13. Invite the child to return the pieces and to choose an activity to do with the puzzle such as an Art activity using the black and white copy of the control chart- coloring and labeling. Or, they can pin-punching the puzzle with construction paper. Still further, they can trace the pieces on fabric and then, with an embroidery hoop, stitch the outlines of the parts in various colors. The outline will likely be enough handwork for the 5/6 year old however, a child who enjoys sewing can fill in the various parts of the fish with a running stitch in chosen colors.

#### THE FISH: CARD AND BOOKLET WORK{.redc}

In Botany and Zoology, we use three-part card and additional card and booklet material. With the young children, three-part cards are used to learn single scientific words such as caudal fin (fish) or upper tentacle (snail). On these cards, the body part is highlighted, often in red. Children typically make their own booklets of names of the parts of the plant or animals using black line masters. With older children, particularly five- and six-year old’s, two part cards are used: the image card has with the body part highlighted and the second card has a definition or explanation on it. The work comes with a booklet that serves as the control for the work. Again, children make their own booklets of the parts of the plants and animals using black line masters and following the booklet work sample/control. The language used on the definition and function cards should be at or slightly above a kindergarten reading level. While the guide can certainly read the cards to the children, they enjoy matching independently the explanation with the body part.

**Materials:**\
Card materials (three-part card with nomenclature and/or definitions with the body part in red) Booklet of the same card material with image of body part in red on one page (typically left) and the definition with the name and function on the opposite page.  

**Prerequisites:**
* Interaction with the specimen and extensions in art, practical life, science, etc
* Lesson and work with the corresponding puzzle 
* Card works in Botany

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right" src="/img/culture/zoo/image036.webp" caption="https://shopmontessoriprintshop.com/collections/in-color-zoology?page=4" >}}

**Direct Aim:**\
Practice reading, identifying and explaining the body parts of an animal

**Indirect Aims:**\
Prepare for individual research 

**Age:** 4-6

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the child to lesson. Recall the specimen lesson and the puzzle lesson which both identified the nomenclature and functions of the animal. 
2. For a three-part card lesson when working with young children use only the names of the body parts and follow the standard three part card lesson.
3. For an older child using the card and booklet material: divide the work into two piles; the image cards and the explanation cards. Place the piles on the right-hand side of the rug, one under the other.
4. Choose an image card. Invite the child to name the body part. If the name is not known, then simply place the card on the upper part of the rug to the left. 
5. Next, choose another image card. Ask the child to name the part such as, the caudal fin and place it to the right of the previous card. 
6. Continue for all the image cards making a row along the rug.
7. Choose an explanation card and read it with the child. Choose the appropriate image card to which it corresponds. Place it under the image card.  Continue until all the explanation cards are paired with the image. 
8. Take the booklet material from the tray or basket. Show the child how to check their work using the booklet.
9. Invite the child to make their own booklet with the black line masters provided.

{{< img class="white-outline float-right w-400" src="/img/culture/zoo/image038.webp" alt="Fish Cards" >}}

10. Remind the child that only the first / cover page has the fully colored animal whereas the successive pages have only the body part highlighted in one color, red or other color of choice. 

**Points of Interest:**
* The function of the body part
* Making a booklet

**Control of Error:**\

### AMPHIBIAN

#### AMPHIBIAN: Specimen{.redc}

{{< box class="white-outline white-bg float-right w-400" >}}
{{< div class="font-bold" >}}Definition of an amphibian and word meaning:{{< /div >}}

{{< div >}}
A cold-blooded vertebrate animal of a class that comprises the frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders. They are distinguished by having an aquatic gill-breathing larval stage followed (typically) by a terrestrial lung-breathing adult stage.{{< /div >}}

{{< div class="my-1" >}}“amphi” means “both kinds” in Greek{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="my-1" >}}“bios” means life; both life in water and on land {{< /div >}}
{{< /box >}}


**Materials:**
* Live specimen of an amphibian if possible:
* Frog, salamander, newt, toad
* Life Cycle miniatures of the life cycle of a frog
* Glass container for containment

**Prerequisites:**\
Other specimen lessons (botany or zoology)

**Direct Aim:**
Teach the characteristics of amphibians: (they are “in between fish and reptiles” – have characteristics of each).

1. Is a vertebrate animal
2. Begins life in water with gills and tails
3. Develops lungs and legs as they grow
4. Has scaleless skin that absorbs water and oxygen
5. Lays eggs, breathes oxygen through the skin

**Indirect Aims:**
* Teach about life cycles
* Teach about changes a body of a living organism undergoes when growing

**Age:** 4-6

**Presentation:**
1. Bring the live specimen to the low table in a container to keep it in such as a glass aquarium. 
2. Begin to compare the frog to the fish they previously observed, whether it was a live or fresh fish. 
3. Discuss the major differences with the students while referring to the fish and also pointing out various parts of the body of the amphibian.
4. Parts of the frog to point out: head, eyes, mouth, hind legs, forelegs
• A fully-grown amphibian does not live in water whereas a fish always lives in water and dies when it is removed since it cannot breathe/ get oxygen from the air; only water. 
• Does not have scales for skin; soft, scaleless skin that is covered in mucus to keep the skin moist when it is out of the water. 
• Does have a head, with a mouth and two nostrils. An adult frog can get oxygen or breathe in three ways: through its skin (it can take in the oxygen from the air); through its mouth (can also take in oxygen from air) and in its lungs, as we humans do.
• Hatches from an egg, like fish and lives in water for a short time
• Goes through metamorphosis

{{< img class="white-outline float-right w-300" src="/img/culture/zoo/image041.webp" alt="Life Cycle of Frog" >}}


5. Bring out the miniature samples of a frog life cycle: tadpole/polliwog, froglet, young frog, adult frog.  As a tadpole, it lives in the water, like a fish, has gills, swims and eats plants. Then, it develops lungs and grown hind legs. These allow it to hop and swim. Then, it grows shorter front legs and the tail gets smaller. Then it develops into an adult frog. (see fuller description at end of lesson)

Explain the phases of the life cycle; emphasize living in the water and living on land and this the name “amphibian” (two kinds of life).

6. Invite the children to draw or write about any phase of the life cycle of a frog.

{{< img class="white-outline float-right w-400" src="/img/culture/zoo/image043.webp" alt="Life Cycle of Frog" >}}

**Points of Interest:**
* Real specimen
* “part fish” and “part reptile” / water and land animal

**Control of Error:**\
Teacher 

**Variations:**\
Use a different animal, such as a salamander

**Extensions:**\
Bring in pond water that has frog eggs and watch them hatch. They will have to be put back in the pond however, for them to successfully live and develop. This is typically not something that can be done in a classroom.

**Vocabulary:** amphibian, tadpole, froglet, life cycle, metamorphosis, stages of growth,

{{< box class="w-100 white-outline white-bg" >}}
{{< div class="font-bold center" >}}Frog Facts for the Life Cycle:{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="font-bold p-1" >}}Stage 1: Egg{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="p-1" >}}A frog begins life as a fertilized egg. A female frog lays a lot of eggs at one time in a pond. The eggs float on water in a jelly mass or cluster. The eggs will soon hatch into tadpoles!{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="font-bold p-1" >}}Stage 2: Tadpole & Froglet{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="p-1" >}}When the tadpole hatches, it looks more like a fish than a frog. It doesn’t have any legs! It has gills that allow it to breathe underwater. The tadpole swims, eats plants and algae from the water, and grows for several weeks.
During this time, the tadpole starts to develop lungs so it will be able to breathe out of the water when it becomes a frog. The tadpole also starts to grow two hind legs. Now it can leap around instead of only swimming. Although the tadpole is starting to look a little more like a frog, it still has a very long tail!{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="font-bold p-1" >}}Stage 3: Young Frog{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="p-1" >}}The tadpole grows two front legs and its long tail becomes shorter and shorter. The tadpole uses the nutrients stored in its tail as food, so until its tail is completely gone, it doesn’t need anything else to eat! Then just a little stub of its tail is left, and the tadpole is a young frog. It hops right out of the water and onto dry land for the first time! The frog is still very small.{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="font-bold p-1" >}}Stage 4: Adult Frog{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="p-1" >}}The frog’s tail will eventually disappear completely, and it will start to eat insects instead of plants from the water. The young frog will grow for about 2-4 years to become an adult. The adult frogs then lay their eggs and more tadpoles hatch and begin the cycle again!{{< /div >}}

#### AMPHIBIAN: Observations and care{.redc}

While it is uncommon, frogs can be pets. If the classroom doesn’t have a pet frog, there are some solutions:
- Go to a stream, pond or natural area and try to catch one temporarily for the specimen presentation and some observations 
- Frogs can be purchased at local pets stores. However, a better option may be to take a small group of children on a field trip to a pet store after introducing most of the 5 groups of Animalia (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals).
- Another option is to check with a local Agriculture Extension Agent or Wildlife Agent and see if they can visit the class and bring live specimens.
- Many children’s science museums have outreach programs that come into classrooms with samples. 
- Sometimes local pet stores will do also come into classrooms as a community involvement gesture
- Organize a trip to a natural area such as a state park with water, lakes or ponds. Again, this would be helpful to schedule after several of the groups from Animalia have been presented.  

**Observation:**\
Use the same approach as previously explained, using a Scientist’s Observation journal. This is a work that is usually appropriate and meaningful for children in their third year of Children’s House. 

Drawing and labeling is both a fun and effective way for children to practice multiple academic areas at once and engage in scientific observation in a meaningful way.

If observation of real specimens is not possible, then another option is to show a 15 – 20 min documentary on frogs or other amphibians. Or to create a audio/visual presentation for the children about amphibians. 

https://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/00000144-0a1e-d3cb-a96c-7b1f84bd0000?gc=%2Fvideo%2Fanimals%2Famphibians&source=relatedvideo

**NOTE ABOUT WATCHING VIDEO:** Always be sure to preview the videos beforehand keeping in mind all the students, their families and the school culture. The audio/visual sensory input from movies and films can be very overwhelming for many children, though this is often overlooked. The senses of sight and hearing are very powerful and create long lasting memories tied to emotions. Thus, seeing a scary action (an animal preying on another) on a large screen can stay with a child consciously and subconsciously for a very long time and cause a good deal of emotional unrest. Be very careful what they children are shown if you choose to use video.

#### AMPHIBIAN: Puzzle of Parts with Functions{.redc}

**Materials:** 
* Frog puzzle
* Control Chart (optional)

**Prerequisites:**\
Botany or Fish puzzles

**Direct Aim:**\
Teach names and functions of body parts on a frog

**Indirect Aims:**
* Prepare for interest driven scientific research
* Incite non-fiction reading

**Age:** 3-6 (Could be done by a 3 yr old on a purely sensorial level)

**Presentation:**   head, mouth, eyes, nostrils, tympanum, torso, forelegs, hind legs, feet.
(Note: Using the control chart can be challenging since there will not be much room to place the labels. However, for a differentiated lesson for a young child or a child with special needs, the control chart may be very helpful). 
1. Bring the frog puzzle to a table with the child. 
2. Name the lesson: the parts and their functions of the frog
3. As with the specimen of the frog, begin with one end or the other. We will begin with the head as in the presentation of the specimen.

{{< box class="p-relative preview-300" >}}

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/zoo/image047.webp" caption="The circle behind the frog’s eye is where the inner ear lies." >}}

{{< box class="arrow" >}}{{< /box >}}

{{< /box >}}

4. Remove the piece of the head and place it to the right of the puzzle at the top of the table. Do the first period lesson: “this is the head of the frog.” Ask the child what they know about the head of a frog. Recollecting the specimen can help. The parts in the head include: the mouth, the nostrils and the eyes. Amphibians can smell. They have tiny openings on the roof of their mouth called external nares that take in different scents directly into their mouths. The external nares also help them breathe, just like a human nose Review the roles of the sense for the frog and its survival needs. Write the word “head”, “eye”, “mouth” and “nostril” and place them next to the piece for the head. If the tympanum (ear) is visible on the puzzle, then this can be identified too) 

5. Next, remove the piece of the torso  body). Place it to the right of the puzzle below the head piece. If the child knows the name, then move directly to writing the word. If the child does not know the name, begin to give its name and function. 

6. Remove the forelegs (2 ) and name them, placing them below the other pieces. Write the names and place them to the right as the other labels. Remind the child that the word “fore” means “ in front”; the legs in front.

7. Remove the piece of the hindleg. Name it and place it with the other pieces. Write the word and place it to the right of the puzzle pieces, making a column below the previous pieces. Review the function of the hind legs for jumping and relate the part to survival. Point out the webbed feet on both the fore and hind legs. 

8. Invite the child to play games to practice the names. Perhaps, bring all the legs pieces together and play a mystery definition game. For example, “I am the leg that is the strongest and makes me leap the farthest. What am I ?”

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/zoo/image034.webp" alt=" Embroidery" >}}

9. Invite the child to return the pieces and to choose an activity to do with the puzzle such as an Art activity using the black and white copy of the control chart- coloring and labeling. Or, they can pin-punching the puzzle with construction paper. Still further, they can trace the pieces on fabric and then, with an embroidery hoop, stitch the outlines of the parts in various colors. The outline will likely be enough handwork for the 5/6 year old however, a child who enjoys sewing can fill in the various parts of the frog with a running stitch in chosen colors.

### REPTILE

#### REPTILE: Specimen{.redc}

{{< box class="w-400 float-right white-bg p-2" >}}
{{< div class="font-bold" >}}Definition and meaning of word{{< /div >}}
{{< div >}}A vertebrate animal of a class that includes snakes, lizards, crocodiles, turtles, and tortoises. They are distinguished by having a dry scaly skin and typically laying soft-shelled eggs on land. While they often live and reproduce near water and swim in water, they are land vertebrates.{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="p-1" >}}“reptile” means crawling or creeping{{< /div >}}
{{< /box >}}

**Materials:**\
Live specimen if possible: turtle, snake or lizard

**Prerequisites:**\
Other live specimen lessons on plants and/or animals

**Direct Aim:**
* Teach the characteristics of reptiles (versus other vertebrates)
* Interact with a reptile and identify its characteristics through sensorial interaction 

**Indirect Aims:**
* Prepare for other lessons on reptiles 
* Incite interest, reading about and/or research on reptiles
* Promote non-fiction reading

**Age:** 3-6

**Presentation:** (turtle): trunk, shell, eyes, limbs, head, tail, and claws.

1. Bring the live specimen to the low table in a container to keep it in such as a glass aquarium. 

2. Begin to compare the turtle to the fish and/or amphibian previously observed, whether they were real specimens, models or videos. 

3. Discuss the major differences with the students while referring to the previously seen vertebrates and while also pointing out various parts of the body of the reptile.

4. Parts of the reptile to point out: skin type, head, eyes, mouth, limbs, claws, tail, trunk, shell,
	* Reptiles live on land, but some reptiles spend time in or near water, such as a sea turtle and crocodile.  Like other vertebrates, they have a head that has a mouth, two nostrils and eyes.
	{{< img class="white-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/culture/zoo/image053.webp" alt="Snake Skin" >}}
	* A reptile breathes oxygen, like humans (mammals) and do not start out in the water, like an amphibian. Also, unlike an amphibian, their skin cannot absorb oxygen to help with breathing when out of the water, as in an amphibian. They cannot breathe in the water, like a fish or young amphibian. However, they can hold their breath for a very long time compared to humans. A crocodile can hold its breath for easily 20 minutes underwater. 
	* The skin is usually dry and has scales at least somewhere on their body. Some are completely covered in scales, such as a snake while others are not.  Most reptiles have a skin or outer covering, a shell for protection.
	* Reptiles lay eggs which are either leathery (a turtle) or hard shelled. They lay eggs in land and in a nest that the female guards carefully, as does a bird. 
	* Some reptiles have legs, and some have none; a snake has none while a turtle has four.
	* All reptiles have sharp claws (if they have limbs) that they use for eating and protection. 
	* Reptiles were one of the first land only animals on earth- many of the dinosaurs were reptiles, most of them giant reptiles! (Note: The study of phylogenies is now informing us that the dinosaurs were likely warm-blooded animals and thus not “reptiles” as we know reptiles today.

#### REPTILE: OBSERVATION AND CARE{.redc}

As mentioned above with the fish and the amphibian, there are several ways to bring children in contact with live specimens to see/ hear/ touch/ smell the characteristics of reptiles if the classroom does not have one as a pet. 
Still another idea is to inquire in other classrooms, particularly Elementary I and II classrooms for reptiles; they often like to have pets such as iguanas, lizards and the like! Ask about borrowing this pet for a week for observation and care. This request could be merged with a language activity of writing a letter of request.

#### REPTILE: Puzzle of Parts with Functions{.redc}

**Materials:**\
Turtle Puzzle

**Prerequisites:**\
Other botany or zoology puzzle lessons

**Direct Aim:**\
Teach the parts and basic functions of a reptile

**Indirect Aims:**
* Prepare for other lessons on reptiles 
* Incite interest, reading about and/or research on reptiles
* Promote non-fiction reading

**Age:** 3-6

**Presentation:**  turtle, head, tympanum, eyes, nostrils, jaw, neck, carapace, plastron, forelegs, hind legs, clawed feet, and tail.
(Note: Using the control chart can be challenging since there will not be much room to place the labels. However, for a differentiated lesson for a young child or a child with special needs, the control chart may be very helpful). 

1. Bring the turtle puzzle to a table with the child.

2. Name the lesson: the parts and their functions of the reptile

3. As with the specimen of the turtle, begin with one end or the other.

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/zoo/image057.webp" caption="The name of this turtle, Red-eared slider shows where the tympana are on a turtle." >}}

4. Remove the piece of the head and place it to the right of the puzzle at the top of the table. Do the first period lesson: “this is the head of the turtle.” Ask the child what they know about the head of a turtle. Recollecting the specimen can help. The parts in the head include: the mouth, the nostrils, the tympanum/a and the eyes. Reptiles have a developed sense of smell. Some reptiles use their tongue to smell, such as a snake.  Review the roles of the senses of smell and sight for survival needs. Discuss the neck of a turtle, its functions. Also, the jaws that make up the mouth. Write the words “head”, “eye”, “mouth”, “nostril”, “jaw” and “neck” and place them next to the piece for the head. If the tympanum (ear) is visible on the puzzle, then this can be identified too) 
5. Next, remove the piece of the carapace (upper shell). Place it to the right of the puzzle below the head piece. Say the name and then move directly to writing the word. Give the simple function of the carapace: to protect the inner body.  

6. Next, remove the piece of the plastron (lower shell). Place it to the fight of the puzzle below the carapace piece and write the write the label as you name it. Give its basic function together with the carapace; full protection since all its appendages can be withdrawn inside. (“plastra” means “breastplate”)

7. Remove the piece of the foreleg (only 1 is shown but there are two) and name it. Then place it below the other pieces. Write the name and place them to the right as the other labels. Remind the child that the word “fore” means “in front”; the legs in front.

8. Remove the piece of the hindleg. Name it and place it with the other pieces. Write the word and place it to the right of the puzzle pieces, making a column below the previous pieces. Review the function of the hind legs for walking and swimming; relate the parts to survival. Point out the webbed feet on both the fore and hind legs. Also, point out the claws on the feet. Discuss the function of claws and webbed feet. Write the word “claw” next to the leg pieces. 

9. Finally, remove the tail piece. Compare the tail of a fish (for locomotion) and the tail of a turtle? For turtles, the reproductive organs are in the tail, thus a different function and important to survival of the species. 

10.  Invite the child to play games to practice the names. Perhaps, play a mystery definition game. For example, “I am useful for protecting the turtle and I am flat: What am I ?”

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/zoo/image034.webp" alt=" Embroidery" >}}

11. Invite the child to return the pieces and to choose an activity to do with the puzzle such as an Art activity using the black and white copy of the control chart- coloring and labeling. Or, they can pin-punching the puzzle with construction paper. Still further, they can trace the pieces on fabric and then, with an embroidery hoop, stitch the outlines of the parts in various colors.

Other specimen lessons

**Direct Aim:**\
Teach the characteristics of a bird

**Indirect Aims:** 
* Prepare for learning the parts and functions of the bird
* Prepare for other zoology specimen lessons
* Prepare for the bird puzzle lesson


**Age:** 3-6

**Presentation:**

1. As mentioned with other Specimen lessons, if a classroom does not have immediate access to a live bird, there are many other ways to enable the children to interact with live birds. 

2. For a live bird in a cage, follow the same procedures as with other live specimen lessons:
	- Identify the parts (can name and state function if appropriate)
	- Compare the specimen to other vertebrates comparing and contrasting parts and their functions
	- Summarize the identifying features of the vertebrate so the children become familiar with its defining characteristics


The parts of the bird: beak, head, breast, wing, body, tail, legs, and claws

{{< pure_table
"Bird facts|Other vertebrates"
"Fastest animal – some birds can fly over 100 mph.|Next fastest, some mammals."
"All birds have wings but not all fly: kiwi, ostrich, cassowary, penguins, emu|"
"Warm blooded|Cold-blooded"
"Feathers|None other has feathers and wings (bats are mammals, have wings but no feathers)"
"Hard shell eggs|Leathery or soft shell"
"Largest distance of migrating animals|Other great migrators: certain bats, Christmas Island crabs and salmon"
"Hollow bone|"
"Very light yet very powerful (endurance)|"
"Three means of locomotion: walking, running and flying|Usually only one or two means of locomotion"
"In every habitat/ biome on earth|There are no turtles, mammal, reptiles and amphibians on the Antarctica continent but there are birds!"
"No mouth; no teeth: only a beak|"
"Few animals prepare their place for their offspring as do birds.|Many do not prepare at all;"

#### THE BIRD: Observation and Care{.redc}

One of the easiest ways for a classroom to prepare for bird study is to hang a bird feeder outside a classroom window a few weeks before the study begins. This will allow birds time to discover the feeder and to develop the habit of coming for food. This will give the students many opportunities to see live birds and to do observations and care. 

Bird Feeder projects and types for children:

#### THE BIRD: Puzzle of parts with functions{.redc}

**Materials:**
* Bird Puzzle
* Control chart (optional)

**Prerequisites:**\
Other botany or zoology puzzle lessons

**Direct Aim:**\
Teach the parts and basic functions of a bird

**Indirect Aims:**\
* Prepare for other lessons on birds 
* Incite interest, reading about and/or research on birds
* Promote non-fiction reading

**Age:** 3-6

**Presentation:** beak, head, breast, wing, body, tail, legs, and claws, tail.
(Note: Using the control chart can be challenging since there will not be much room to place the labels. However, for a differentiated lesson for a young child or a child with special needs, the control chart may be very helpful). 

1. Bring the turtle puzzle to a table with the child. 

2. Name the lesson: the parts and their functions of the bird

3. As with the specimen of the turtle, begin with the head.

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/zoo/image069.webp" caption="Many birds can move their heads around more than other animals" >}}

4. Remove the piece of the head and place it to the right of the puzzle at the top of the table. Do the first period lesson: “this is the head of the bird.” Ask the child what they know about the head of a bird. Recollecting the specimen can help. The parts in the head include: the beak and the eyes. Most birds do not have a developed sense of smell, although there are some that have very developed olfactory senses such as the kiwi, vultures, parrots and seabirds.  Review the sense of sight for survival needs. Write the words “head”, “eye”, “beak” and place them next to the piece for the head.   (See chart of beaks and their function at the end of the lesson)

https://www.thespruce.com/birds-five-senses-386441

5. Next, remove the piece of the breast. Name and place piece to the right of the puzzle below the head piece. Then, move directly to writing the word. Give the simple function of the breast: provide the muscles for the wings. The strongest muscles in the bird’s body are the pectorals since they control the wings. 

6. Next, remove the piece of the wing. Place it to the fight of the puzzle below the breast piece and write the write the label as you name it. Give the basic function of the wing: the wings are used for flying. There are three types of flight: There are three basic types of flight: flapping, gliding, and soaring. Flapping is for takeoff; gliding is for coasting downward and soaring is when go up using warm air to help them rise.

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right w-400" src="/img/culture/zoo/image071.webp" alt="Bird Talons Chart" caption="A bird's talons are the sharp, hooked claws at the end of the toes. Birds have one talon on every toe, and they may differ in shape and size depending on how the bird will use its talons and how worn individual talons may be." >}}

7. Remove the pieces of the legs and claws. Then place it below the other pieces. Write the name and place them to the right as the other labels. The claw is also called a “talon;” they have one talon on every toe. They are used by all birds for procuring food and sometimes for protection. 


8. Remove the piece of the tail. Name it and place it with the other pieces. Write the word and place it to the right of the puzzle pieces, making a column below the previous labels. Review the function of the tail: steering in flight. The bird uses its tail to for the direction of where they fly and it uses its tail as brake when it lands. Tail feathers are shaped differently than wing and breast feathers. 

9. Finally, remove the tail piece. Compare the tail of a fish (for locomotion) and the tail of a turtle? For turtles, the reproductive organs are in the tail, thus a different function and important to survival of the species. 

10.  Invite the child to play games to practice the names. Perhaps, play a mystery definition game. For example, “I have the strongest muscles: What am I ?”  

11. Invite the child to return the pieces and to choose an activity to do with the puzzle such as an Art activity using the black and white copy of the control chart- coloring and labeling. Or, they can pin-punching the puzzle with construction paper. Still further, they can trace the pieces on fabric and then, with an embroidery hoop, stitch the outlines of the parts in various colors. The outline will likely be enough handwork for the 5/6 year old however, a child who enjoys sewing can fill in the various parts of the bird with a running stitch in chosen colors.

### MAMMAL

#### MAMMAL: Specimen{.redc}

**Materials:**\
Live mammal

**Prerequisites:** 
Other botany or zoology puzzle lessons

**Direct Aim:** 
Teach the parts and basic functions of a mammal

**Indirect Aims:** 
Prepare for other lessons on mammals including the human body
Incite interest, reading about and/or research on mammals
Promote non-fiction reading

**Age:** 3-6

**Presentation:**
There are many mammals that children come in contact with regularly; dogs, cats, gerbils, hamsters etc. Most pets are mammals. 
Humans are of course, mammals. The children will find this hard to believe but explaining the characteristics of mammals will help them understand. Finding a pet mammal, a dog, for example shouldn’t be problem!  Adjust the parts to fit the mammal specimen used. The Montessori model mammal is the horse whose parts are:  head, ears, eyes, nostril, neck, mouth, mane, torso, forelegs, hind legs, hooves and tail.

http://www.burkemuseum.org/research-and-collections/mammalogy/collections/mtm/

{{< pure_table
"Mammal Common Characteristics|Diversity of mammals"
"Gives birth to live young (eggs inside the body). Mammals are viviparous (“bringing forth alive”) versus other oviparous vertebrates (“bringing forth with eggs”)|humans whales lions bats dogs sea lion monkey koala bear"
"Nurses its young with milk|"
"Has hair on its body|"
"Has a jaw attached to the skull|"
"Has three tiny bones in the ear for hearing|"
"The heart and lungs are separated from the abdominal area|"
>}}

Of the highly developed animals, mammals are the most widespread animals on earth. The invertebrate class of Arthropods while more numerous are not as well developed as mammals.

**Points of Interest:**
* Diversity of mammals
* That humans are mammals

#### MAMMAL: OBSERVATION AND CARE{.redc}

After having presented all of the vertebrates is a good time to take a trip to a farm, a zoo or a nature center. Students can do observations, draw pictures and compare the diversity of mammals.

Also, introducing a pet care chart with the days of the week, the food and water and exercise is often most easily done with care for a mammal since it is likely the most useful for children.

#### MAMMAL: Puzzle of parts with functions{.redc}

**Materials:**\
Horse Puzzle

**Prerequisites:**\
Other botany or zoology puzzle lessons

**Direct Aim:**\
Teach the parts and their basic functions of the horse

**Indirect Aims:**
* Prepare for other lessons on mammals 
* Incite interest, reading about and/or research on mammals
* Promote non-fiction reading

**Age:** 3-6

**Presentation:**  head, ears, eyes, nostril, neck, mouth, mane, torso, forelegs, hind legs, hooves and tail. 
 (Note: Using the control chart can be challenging since there will not be much room to place the labels. However, for a differentiated lesson for a young child or a child with special needs, the control chart may be very helpful). 

1. Bring the horse puzzle to a table with the child. 

2. Name the lesson: the parts and their functions of the horse.
 
3. As with the specimen of the mammal, begin with one end or the other. 

4. Remove the piece of the head and place it to the right of the puzzle at the top of the table. Do the first period lesson: “this is the head of the horse.” Ask the child what they know about the head of a horse. Recollecting the mammal specimen can help. The parts in the head include: the mouth, the nostrils, the ears and the eyes. The sensory systems for all mammals are very developed. Horses have ears that are funnel shaped to collect the sound waves, especially when they are moving.   A horse’s sense of smell is much more acute than that of a human however, it is not as developed as is a dog’s.  Review the roles of the senses of smell and sight for survival needs. Write the words “head”, “eye”, “mouth” and place them next to the piece for the head. 


5. Next, remove the piece of the neck. Place it to the right of the puzzle below the head piece. Say the name and then move directly to writing the word. Give the simple function of the neck: the neck serves as a balancing arm for the head.  In order for the head to be so far removed from the body, it needs a strong thick, muscle-laden body part to hold it up. This is the role of the neck of a horse. It requires sensory integration of the visual, vestibular and proprioceptive systems to make this balancing act work and for the horse to be both controlled by humans with reigns and to control itself.

6. Next, remove the mane and place it to the right of the puzzle. Name and write the word, planning the label to the right of the mane puzzle piece. This is made of hair and its function is to: keep the neck warm, help water run off the body and finally, to cover and protect the neck (from a bite for example from another animal). Because the neck carries and holds the head (which in the mammal holds the complex brain and sensory systems), the neck has to carefully protected.

7. Remove the piece of the body. Name it and place it with the other pieces. Write the word and place it to the right of the puzzle pieces, making a column below the previous labels. Review the function of the body: holds all the internal organs including where the babies grow. Because the horse is a mammal, the babies grow inside the mother (as opposed to eggs that are laid and hatch in a nest) and are born alive. Baby horses can walk within a few hours of being born. 

8. Next, remove the piece of the forelegs. Place it to the right of the puzzle below and write the write the label as you name it. Give their basic functions:  absorb impact, bear weight, and provide thrust. In general, the majority of the weight of a horse is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion.

9. Remove the piece of the hindlegs and name it. Then place it below the other pieces. Write the name and place them to the right as the other labels. The function of the hind legs is to provide power for locomotion. The hind legs have “two knees” – two joints before the hip joint. Also, both fore- and hindlegs in horses can “lock” in place which is why a horse can sleep and relax while standing up and not get tired.  Point to the hooves on all the legs. Write the word (s) [ hoof/hooves] and explain their function:  support the weight of the horse, dissipate the energy impact as the hooves strike the ground or surface, protect the tissues and bone within the hoof capsule, and finally provide traction for the horse.

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right w-400" src="/img/culture/zoo/image077.webp" alt="Horse Tail Swishing" caption="Swishing tail: typically a contented and happy horse" >}}

10. Finally, remove the tail piece. Compare the tail of a fish (for locomotion) and the tail of a turtle for reproduction. The tail is made of hair, has no bones, organs, blood, nerves in it. It is used to protect the horse from insects, especially flies. Also, the function of the tail is to communicate: we can learn about the horse’s emotional and/or physical state by looking at the various movements and position of a horse’s tail.

{{< /box >}}

**Materials:**\
Several live arthropods such as fly, ant, spider, crab, shrimp, butterfly, ladybug

**Prerequisites:**
* Lesson on Vertebrate/Invertebrate
* Other botany or zoology puzzle lessons

**Direct Aim:**\
Teach the characteristics and parts of an arthropod

**Indirect Aims:**
* Prepare for other lessons on invertebrates
* Incite interest, reading about and/or research on invertebrates
* Promote non-fiction reading

**Age:** 3-6

**Presentation:**
1. If possible, this lesson is best done outside in a natural area where insects live and breed. Otherwise, a container or small terrarium for the insects, ladybugs or crab. 
2. Review the definition and characteristics of an invertebrate:

{{< pure_table
"Invertebrate: octopus, crab, worm|Vertebrate: human, lizard, bird"
"Have no backbone|Have a backbone"
"Have exoskeleton (outside)|Have a skeleton (inside)"
"Have a primitive nervous system|Have a well-developed nervous system"
"An outer layer, shell or exoskeleton|Have an outer covering of protective skin"
"98% of all animals|Only 2 % of all animals"
"If they have legs, they can have many and often they are jointed in several places.|Some vertebrates have no legs, snakes.  Most vertebrates have two pairs of limbs; for fish and birds, they have fins and wings."
"Most hatch from eggs and many go through metamorphosis to become the adult|Some hatch from eggs some from go through metamorphosis and some vertebrates have eggs inside and the young are born live"
"Soft flexible bodies|Much less flexible due to skeleton"
"Largest number of animals in the world; most familiar groups of invertebrates: arthropods, mollusks, annelids, and cnidarians (coral, hydras, jellyfish etc.)|There are 5 major groups of vertebrates: fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals"
>}}

3. Explain that just as there are a wide range of vertebrates: fish, humans, birds, turtles etc. there is also a wide range of invertebrates. In fact, most the of animals on earth are invertebrates (98%).
4. Examine the specimens of the crab or ant/beetle. Both have no backbone, both have jointed legs and many legs. Their bodies are symmetrical: two matching sides. The bodies are segmented, and each has a pair of legs.

{{< div class="font-bold center" >}}Definitions and etymology{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="my-1">}}An invertebrate of a large phylum which includes snails, slugs, mussels, and octopuses. They have a soft unsegmented body and live in aquatic or damp habitats, and most kinds have an external calcareous shell.{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="my-1">}}The words mollusc and mollusk are both derived from the French mollusque, which originated from the Latin molluscus, from mollis, meaning soft referring to their bodies, many of which are inside the protective shell. Octopuses for example do not have a shell.{{< /div >}}
{{< /box >}}

**Materials:**\
Live snails, clams or mussels

**Prerequisites:**
* Lesson on Vertebrate/Invertebrate
* Other botany or zoology puzzle lessons

**Direct Aim:**\
Teach the characteristics and parts of an arthropod

**Indirect Aims:**
* Prepare for other lessons on invertebrates
* Incite interest, reading about and/or research on invertebrates
* Promote non-fiction reading

**Age:** 3-6

**Presentation:**
1. Place the mollusk (snail) on the low table with a plastic mat. Maintain a quiet environment in order for the snail to emerge from its shell. It is likely that it will be hidden in its shell given that it was moved/ picked up.
{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/zoo/image102.webp" alt="Snail Closeup" caption="Snail eyes are at the tips of the tentacles" >}}
2. Engage the children in a discussion of the snail as an invertebrate with a soft body inside and a hard shell outside. Discuss locomotion: compare the many legs of a spider, crab or insect to the absence of legs/ appendages on a crustacean. 
3. Locomotion for snails: the snail moves with its one highly muscular foot that glides forward and then the muscles in the foot contract all along the whole body. Snails also secrete slime to help make the surface smooth in order to move more easily. They can move over rough, shape and uneven surfaces very easily with the muscular foot and slime. 
4. Clams also have one foot that they use to move and bury themselves in the sand for protection against large fish, mammals and birds. 
5. Parts to identify with the children: shell, foot, tentacles, eyes and antennae. The small antennae are used for feeling and smell. The shell serves as protection; it grows with the snail. Snails are born with a shell and it harder as they get older. They have to eat a lot of vegetables to get calcium to keep growing their shell! 
6. While most mollusks, especially bivalves move slowly or not at all; rather they attach to something, such as oysters and mussels. Some mollusks such as the octopus can move quickly (25 mph) but not for long.  In general, mollusks are slow moving animals.

#### MOLLUSKS: Puzzle of parts with functions{.redc}

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right w-400" src="/img/culture/zoo/image106.webp" alt="Snail Puzzle" caption="Snail puzzle with control that has numbers and labels http://www.lisheenmontessori.com" >}}

**Materials:**\
Snail puzzle

**Prerequisites:**
* Lesson on Vertebrate/Invertebrate
* Other botany or zoology puzzle lessons

**Direct Aim:**\
Teach the characteristics and parts of a mollusk

**Indirect Aims:**
* Prepare for other lessons on invertebrates
* Incite interest, reading about and/or research on invertebrates
* Promote non-fiction reading

**Age:** 3-6

**Presentation:**
All the puzzles follow the same procedures as previous puzzles. 
- Remove the piece
- Name the part and write the label
- Identify if appropriate further parts of the animal on a given piece. Here, the tentacles, eye spots and mouth all on one puzzle piece. 
- If age and interest appropriate, give a description of the function of the parts of the animal. 
https://www.snail-world.com/snail-anatomy/

1. Eye spots: For sight, located on tips of tentacles, vision is moderate and likely related to why they move slowly.
2. Upper tentacles: have eyes at the tips and can retract and extend for better vision. As soon as they come in contact with anything, they retract. This is mostly to protect the eyes which are fragile.
3. Lower tentacles: these are lower on the body and can are used the sense of smell and touch. They too can extend and retract.

4. Muscular foot: the way a snail and other gastropods (mollusks) move. The foot contracts the muscles in the foot in waves as it moves forward. 
5. Shell: the protective out layer of the animal. Snails (and other mollusks) do not change shells throughout their life time. The shells grow! They are made of calcium carbonate (related to chalk, limestone and coral) and the shell grows from the edge. 
6. Apex: tip of the shell, usually exactly opposite in location to the aperture ( the opening where the foot come out. 
7. Mouth: on the underside of the head; it is a round opening that is smaller than the head of a pin but has over 1,000 teeth. 
8. Respiratory pore: a hole, called a pneumostome, located usually on the right side of the body where the snail breathes.

### ANNELIDS

#### ANNELIDS: Specimen

{{< box class="white-bg p-2 float-right w-300" >}}
{{< div class="font-bold center" >}}Definitions and etymology{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="my-1">}}Annelids, also known as the ringed worms or segmented worms, are a large phylum, with over 22,000 extant species including ragworms, earthworms, and leeches.{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="my-1">}}Annelid comes for latin annulus “little ring” (diminutive for anus) and the Greek word eidos “form or shape”. Small ring-shaped animals.{{< /div >}}
{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/culture/zoo/image114.webp" alt="Worm Closeup" >}}
{{< /box >}}

**Materials:**\
Live annelids such as earthworms 

**Prerequisites:**
* Lesson on Vertebrate/Invertebrate
* Other botany or zoology puzzle lessons

**Direct Aim:**\
Teach the characteristics and parts of an earthworm

**Indirect Aims:**
* Prepare for other lessons on invertebrates
* Incite interest, reading about and/or research on invertebrates
* Promote non-fiction reading

**Age:** 3-6

**Presentation:**\
As with all the specimen lessons: respect the animal, meet its needs for a stable and safe environment and replace it in its natural habitat following observation. 

**Observation and discussion topics of earthworms:**
1. Locomotion: setae (small bristles) cover the body and help it move; also, like a mollusk, they secrete a fluid through their skin to help them move, expect it is all over the body whereas the mollusk is just on the bottom of the muscular foot. 
2. Head: the end where the mouth is; nothing else
3. No outer protection (no shell)
4. No eyes; they use sensors in their skin to sense light and touch
5. Reproduction: They lay eggs that make their way with the help of slime to the ring (clitellum) around the middle of the worm. The eggs are fertilized, and the ring moves towards the head and falls off when the eggs are close to ready to hatch. The clitellum closes making a cocoon and then, within a few weeks the baby worms emerge fully formed. 
6. Breathing: no lungs or gills; they breathe through their skin
7. Eating: Worms are a tube within a tube; they have a separate inner tube from their mouth to their anus.  Earthworms are vital to soil health and to plants growing in it because they transport nutrients and minerals from below to the surface via their waste. An earthworm can eat up to a third of its body weight in a day.
