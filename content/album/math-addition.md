### Introduction to Symbols: “+” and “=”
**NOTE:** This same approach may be used to introduce other operational symbols: ×, - , ÷

**Materials:**\
12 objects in a container, two small shallow bowls, one larger shallow bowl, 2 (laminated /wooden) cards-one with “+” sign and one with “=” sign, pencil, pieces of paper cut to about 3”x3” (Post-It Notes, or cut-in-half 3”x5” cards work well)

The “+” and “=” signs should be in a closed box.

**Prerequisites:**
* numbers 0-12
* association of quantity and symbol
* number sequencing
* number composition
* numeration activities
* decimal activities
* teen board

**Direct Aim:**
* prepare for abstraction
* understand meaning of “+” and “-“
* understand concept of a “number story”

**Indirect Aim:**
practice the process of addition

**Age:** 4-5 years

**Presentation:**
1.  Sit next to the child. Teacher and child should each have a small container in front of them.

2.  The larger bowl/plate should be placed in the center of the rug.

3.  Hand the child the container of objects and ask them to put a quantity in your bowl. “Please give me 3 _____.”

4.  Invite the child to give themselves a defined quantity, “Now, please give yourself 6 ___.”

5.  Write the number down as you make the observation. “So, I have 3 (write 3 on paper and place next to bowl) and you have 6 (write 6 on paper and place next to child’s bowl).”

6.  “I wonder how much we have all together. Let’s pour our _____ into this bowl. (Pour your objects into the larger bowl and gesture to child to do the same.)  Let’s put our ____ all together.” 

7.  Move the larger bowl closer and count the objects one by one, out loud, placing objects in a line, left to right.

8.  “All together, we have 9!” (Write 9 on a paper and place it next to the line of objects.) 

9.  Pick up the number papers. “3 (Put the “3” paper down.) together with 6 (Put the “6” paper down to the right, leaving room for the “+” sign.) is 9.” (Put down the 9 paper, leaving room for the “=” sign.) Point at the number papers while you say, “3 together with 6 is 9.”

10.  Now, you need to integrate the symbols into the number story with the child… “Now, if somebody just sees these three numbers here, they won’t know what we did. They won’t know the story – that I had 3 and you had 6 and we put them all together and then we had 9. It just looks like three numbers. Hmmm. Wait! I have an idea. We need to use these!”

11.  Pick up the box and take out one “+” sign and one “=” sign. “These will help us tell our story.”

12.  Point to the “+” sign. “This means together with.”  Then, point to the “=” sign.  “This means is/makes.”

13.  Place the symbols in the appropriate location as you say the number story. Invite the child to tell the story too.

14.  Perform a three-period lesson on symbols.

**Points of Interest:**
* objects
* pouring objects together
* signs in a box
* composition of number story

**Control of Error:**
* child’s successful experience with earlier math lessons
* teacher’s careful observation that child is ready for the lesson
* working with teacher or older child

**Variations:**
* Child may use control mat that indicates where to place objects and placement of the “+” and “=” signs.
* Child may use number tiles if unable to write numbers

**Extensions:**
Extend the lesson by asking about more and less: “Give yourself more than I have.” Or, “Who has more? You or me?”

**Vocabulary:**
* signs
* “together with”
* “is” or “is the same as” or “makes”

### Red and Blue Rods - Addition

**Materials:**\
Red and Blue rods, numeral cards, 2 sets of “+” and “=” signs

**Prerequisites:**
* numbers 0-10
* association of quantity and symbol
* number sequencing
* numeration activities
* decimal activities
* introduction to addition activities

**Direct Aim:**
* practice adding numbers 1-10
* reinforce knowledge of + and = signs

**Indirect Aim:**\
preparation for abstract addition

**Age:** 4-5 years old

{{< img class="float-right" src="/img/math/addition/image001.webp" alt="Red and Blue Rods" >}}

**Presentation:**
1.  Grade the rods as in the initial presentation of this material with 1 at bottom of the work rug and 10 at top. Placement of rods should leave an open area at the bottom of the rug for the lesson. 

2.  Select two smaller rods (2, 3) and place them toward the bottom of the rug, end to end, maintaining the red, blue pattern.

3.  Place one flat palm of your hand on either end of the combined rods. “These two rods together are this long.”

4.  “Can you please find one rod that is this long? Can you find the rod that is the same as these two rods together?”

5.  When the child selects a rod, encourage them to compare it (in a sensorial way) with the two combined rods by placing it directly below the combined rods.  If they are equivalent, say, “You found the rod that is the same as these two rods put together,” while placing one flat palm of your hand on either end of the rods. “It was the 5 rod.”

6.  Say, “Yes. These are the same.” Then, push the 5 rod down to create a visual “=” sign with the rods. Place the “=” sign next to the two parallel, horizontal rod(s). Say, “This (point to = sign) means; ‘is the same as.’” You may want to point out that the “=” sign is like a drawing of the rods being considered.

7.  Then, turn your attention to the 2 and 3 rods. Place the “+” sign between the rods. Say, “Remember, this means; ‘together with.’”

8. “Now we are ready to tell the number story.” Move the appropriate object as you tell the number story.

9. “2, together with 3, is the same as 5.” Move the appropriate rod or sign as you tell the number story.

10.  Invite the child to tell the number story too. Demonstrate how to write the number story. 

11.  Consider a three-period lesson for the symbols.

12.  Assessment idea: Teacher tells a number story and the child collects the correct rods and signs and places them in the corresponding equation.

**Points of Interest:**
* finding the match/equivalent for the two smaller rods
* using the signs
* telling the number story

**Control of Error:**
* child’s successful experience with earlier math lessons
* teacher’s careful observation that child is ready for the lesson

**Variations:**\
use tabletop rod material

**Extensions:**
* write the equation
* find equivalent for three smaller rods
* start with the larger rod and find smaller rods that make the equivalent

**Vocabulary:**
* “The ___ rod, together with the ___ rod is the same as the ___ rod.”
* “The ___ rod and ___ rod, together, are the same as the ___ rod.”

### Bead Bars - Addition

**Materials:**
box of colored bead bars – enough to construct three bead stairs
signs for “+” and “=”

**Prerequisites:**
Understanding process of addition
Understanding the idea of a number story
Introduction to addition lessons
Addition with red and blue rods

**Direct Aim:**
Practicing process of addition 1-10
Writing addition equations
Using equation booklets

**Indirect Aim:**
Preparation for abstract number work
Preparation for memorizing addition tables
Preparation for flexibility in thinking – vertical addition

**Age:** 4-5 years

**Presentation I: Sensorial**
1. Select any two bead bars that results in a sum of 10 or less, and place them on the rug in front of the child. Place the bead bars end to end, in a horizontal line.

2. Count the beads. Retrieve the bead bar that equals the combined quantity of beads – the sum of the two bead bars. Place the sum bead bar below the addend bead bars.

3. Show that the two bead bars are the same as the sum bead bar. “The ___ bead bar and ___ bead bar, when joined together, are the same as the ___ bead bar.”

4. Return the bead bars and continue with other combinations.



**Presentation II: Include + and = in the number story**
1. Follow the same steps as Presentation I but extend the lesson to write down the “number story” and include the symbols “+” and “=” in the story.
2. Use paper and pencil to write down the equation as you tell the number story. “Three, combined with two, is the same as five. Three plus two equals five.”

{{< img class="" src="/img/math/addition/image002.webp" alt="Bead Bars" >}}

**Points of Interest:**
Colorful bead bars

**Control of Error:**
Visual – see that the two addend bead bars are the same length as the sum bead bar

**Variations:** Utilize three sets of the black and white bead stair from the snake game, helping children to see the exact correspondence with the 1 and 2 making the exact same bead bar as the three, etc. 

**Vocabulary:** “plus” is the same as combined with, “equals” means is

### Addition Strip Board

**Materials:**
* Addition Strip Board – heavy line dividing the board vertically after the 10th square
* Corresponding red strips and blue strips (1-9)
* Addition Charts I and II
* Addition table booklets 1-3
* Set 1 – problems for a particular fact table arranged in sequence 1+1, 1+2, 1+3 …
* Set 2 – problems for a particular fact table arranged NOT in sequence, 1+7. 1+3+, 1+6 …
* Set 3 – problems from all tables are used in sets of ten and are not in order, 2+5, 7+8, 3+3 …

**Prerequisites:**
* Introduction to process of addition
* Experience with addition sign and equal sign
* Experience with reading equations

**Direct Aim:**
* Practice with the process of addition
* Experience with all the addition facts
* Experience finding all the combinations to build a given number

**Indirect Aim:**\
Experience to lead to memorization of addition facts

**Age:** 4.5-5.5 years

**Presentation:**
Maria Montessori writes, in Psychoarithmetic, “The purpose of this board is to show clearly the way to make tens.” (page 36)

**Presentation I – two-strip combinations to make 10**
1. “We are going to use this board to find all the ways we can make ten.” “We will use these blue (left side) and red (right side) strips to help us.”

2. Point to the vertical dividing line. “This line shows us where to stop.” “We will know that we have ten when we fill in all the squares on this side of the line.” (point) “There are 10 squares.” Ask the child to count the squares to confirm this.

3. Start with the nine strip, “Nine is almost 10 so we will start with that strip.” Place the nine strip at the top left of the board. Point to the empty 10 square. “We need one more to reach 10. We will use the red one to fill that space.” Place the red one strip on the board. “Nine and one together make 10.”

4. “Let’s try eight now.” Place the blue eight strip directly under the blue nine strip. Point to the two empty squares to reach ten. “We need two more to reach 10.” Ask the child to place the two strip. “Eight, together with two make 10.”

5. Continue in this way until all the strips are used. You may write the equations at this point to create a what-combinations-make-10 list. You may also ask the child what they notice about the strips on the board. (stair pattern, as blue strips get shorter the red strips get longer…)

6. “Now, we will look for some patterns – we will look for pairs. We will start with this blue one strip joined with the red nine strip.” (slide the 1+9 combination of strips to the bottom of the board) 

7. “One and nine. Nine and one.” (point) “Do you see another nine and one joined together?” (move your hand over the square, point to the strips) 

8. Child finds the blue nine and red one combination. Move that to the bottom of the board.

9. “These combinations are the same. One and nine makes 10 and nine and one makes 10.” “We will take this one off the board.” Move the 1+9 combination off the board.

10. “We will look at this one next.” Slide the 2+8 combination down. “Two and eight joined together make 10. Do you see another two and eight joined together?” (Child finds the 8+2 combination.) Move the 8+2 combination down and place in above the 2+8. 

11. “These combinations are the same. Eight and two makes 10 and two and eight makes 10. We will take this one off the board.” (Move the 2+8 combination off the board.)

12. Continue with the blue three joined with the red seven.

13. When the duplicates are separated, slide the group of strips on the board up so they line up with the strips that are off the board. Read the combinations. 9+1, 1+9, 8+2, 2+8 etc. 
The child may be invited to record these combinations.

**Presentation II – two-strip combinations to make a given number**\
Presentation 1 may be repeated with other numbers.

**Presentation III – solving addition table equations**
1. Place the blue strips on the left side of the board and the red strips on the right side of the board.

2. Select an addition facts table equation sheet

3. Identify the equation sheet. “This is the Table of One.” (Point to the heading at the top of the sheet)  “This tells us which blue strip to use.” Then, take the appropriate blue strip and place it on the board, under the numbers at the top, to the far left of the board.

4. Read the first equation (to demonstrate for the child) “One plus one.” Then, place the red one strip to the right of the blue one strip. The sum is directly above the red strip. Point to it and ask the child to write the sum on the equation sheet.

5. Replace the red strip and ask the child to read the next equation. Continue in this way until the table is completed.

**Points of Interest:**
* A new material to explore the operation of addition
* Using the red and blue strips

**Control of Error:**
* Observation by teacher to determine readiness
* Visual – see that the equation is shown correctly on the board and the strips line up 
* Hearing the correct language for the number story

**Extensions:**\
Combine with the addition charts – check equations after creating/writing them

### Golden Bead Material – Static Addition

**Materials:**
* Golden Bead Material
* ‘+’ and ‘=’ signs (may be on paper used to record number story)
* 2 sets of small decimal cards
* 1 set of large decimal cards
* Tray for each child in the group
* Static addition equation card – Initially, the teacher refers to this equation. Later, the student will use the equation card.

**Prerequisites:**
* decimal layout
* previous activities with addition (red and blue rods, bead bars, strip board)
* fetching, composing, and reading numbers 
* reading plus and equal signs

**Direct Aims:**
* Practice using the golden bead material
* Add two or more numbers that do not involve exchanging
* Introduce or reinforce the meaning of ‘+’ and ‘=’ signs

**Indirect Aims:**
* Reinforce place value through the process of addition
* Develop abstraction and mathematical mind
* Prepare for learning addition facts

**Age:** 4.5-5 years

**Presentation:**
1.  Give the child a small numeral card(s) and ask them to fetch the quantity and bring the cards and quantity to the work rug. OR, if two children are in the lesson, give each child a tray with the numeral cards for “their” quantity.

Teacher may provide all numeral cards at once on the tray or give the child one hierarchy at a time.

2.  The child should have already practiced fetching, composing, and reading numbers. Ask the child to organize the wooden cards and golden bead material on the rug; number cards on the left side of the rug in a vertical column with 1000s at the top, and golden beads organized to the right of the cards horizontally with 1000s, then 100s, then 10s, and 1s.

3. Now, compose the number by stacking the cards while saying the quantity. Say the 1000s, then say the 100s while placing it on top of the zeros in the 1000s. Then, say the 10s while placing it on top of the zeros in the 100s. Finally, say the 1s while placing it on top of the zero in the 10s. 

4. Read the composed number. (May want to “peak at the zeros” to show they are still there.)

5. Gather the bead material for the second number. (repeat steps 1-4)

6. Beginning with the units, combine the units at the bottom of the rug and then count the units one at a time into your subdominant hand. When the count is complete, close your fist and say, “___ units.”

7. Put the units down in the units column in the sums place and then collect the corresponding large numeral card. Place the card under the quantity of units.

8. Repeat steps 6 & 7 for the remaining hierarchies.

9.  When each decimal hierarchy has been combined, counted, and labeled with a large wooden number card, compose the answer on the left side of the rug. Start by moving over the 1000 card. Move the cards and say the quantity as in step 3. Then read the composed number.

10. Read the equation.

11. Record the number story on an equation sheet.

**Points of Interest:**
* Seeing large and small number cards
* Seeing golden beads all together
* Carrying the quantities of beads
* Superimposing the numeral cards



**Control of Error:**
* Accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness
* Preparation of the child with prerequisite lessons
* Seeing that the beads do not correspond to the numeral cards

**Variations:**
* Use an operations mat
* Have children make up their own equations

**Extensions:**
* Stamp game
* Write equations

**NOTE:** You may validly proceed from this point to three different places: dynamic addition with the golden bead material; static addition with more abstract materials (stamp game/bead frame); or work on memorizing addition facts with the addition strip board, bead bars, and finger charts.  Each in its own way is more difficult. Don’t hurry the child away from this point.  It’s a critical point and the child may welcome reinforcement.

### Golden Bead Material – Dynamic Addition

**Materials:**
* Golden Bead Material
* ‘+’ and ‘=’ signs (may be on paper used to record number story)
* 2 sets of small decimal cards
* 1 set of large decimal cards
* Tray for each child in the group
* Static addition equation card – Initially, the teacher refers to this equation. Later, the student will use the equation card.

**Prerequisites:**
* Exchange activities – very important
* Understanding of decimal system
* Understanding of static addition
* Static addition with golden bead material
* Building and reading composed numbers
* Reading plus and equal signs

**Direct Aims:**
* Practicing dynamic addition process
* Understanding dynamic addition process
* Practice using the golden bead material
* Continue to practice adding two or more numbers that do not involve exchanging
* Reinforce the meaning of ‘+’ and ‘=’ signs

**Indirect Aims:**
* Reinforce place value through the process of addition
* Develop abstraction and mathematical mind
* Prepare for learning addition facts

**Age:** 4.5-5 years

**Presentation:**

1. Use small numeral cards to indicate the needed quantity. Ask the child to gather the golden bead material, organize the quantity and numerals on the work rug, and compose and read the numbers being added. Use the same approach as in the dynamic addition presentation. 

2. The key difference in this lesson is that the child will need to exchange when ten of any quantity is reached.  “Whenever we get ten, we stop and exchange.” 

**NOTE:** The units and ten bars should be counted into the child’s subdominant hand.  “7, 8, 9 10! Stop! Exchange.” This two-handed exchange process is an important skill to develop. It will be used in the stamp game too. When the child says, “Stop. Exchange.” then they will go to the golden bead material source (on a rug, on the shelf, with a “banker” child at a rug or table…) to make the exchange. The beads and bead bars can simply be transported in the child’s hand. The 100 squares can be carried on a tray. Encourage the child to articulate the exchange, “I have ten ones and I need to exchange for a ten bar.”

3. When the child returns with the exchanged-for quantity, that object/quantity should be placed in the next hierarchy’s column, in the bottom row. It will then be combined in the next count. For example, when a child returns with a 10 bar after exchanging 10 unit beads, that 10 bar should go at the bottom of the rug, under the other groups of tens. Then, when the 10 bars are moved to the bottom of the rug and combined for a count, that new 10 bar will already be there.

4. Finish the dynamic equation in the same way as the static equation. Gather a large number card for each combined quantity, compose the large cards to show the sum, read the sum, record the number story.

**Points of Interest:**
* (same as static)
* Exchanging quantities
* Working with a friend – if there is a banker

**Control of Error:**
* Child’s experience and success with previous math materials
* Teacher’s observation skills and awareness of child’s readiness

**Variations:**\
Child makes up his/her own equation

**Extensions:**\
Multiplication with other materials – bead frame

**Vocabulary:**
* Two-handed exchange
* Add, addition, equal, plus, exchange

### Stamp Game – Static Addition

**Materials:**
Stamp Game 
Something to separate numeral quantities – string, felt strip, dowel, pencil
Equations – written on equation paper, laminated pre-written equations or transition with wooden numeral equations
2 sets of small numeral cards
1 set of large numeral cards
= and + signs

**Prerequisites:**
Static addition with golden bead material
Coordination, concentration, order

**Direct Aim:**
Understand the process of addition using more abstract materials
Reinforce place value and decimal system
Practice working with written equations 

**Indirect Aim:**
Grow toward abstraction
Develop the mathematical mind, accuracy, order, concentration

**Age:** 5 - 5.5 years

**Presentation:**\
**Presentation 1:**\
**NOTE:** Transition from golden bead material: Before starting the lesson, use the decimal material introductory tray and one stamp from each hierarchy to alert the child that the material no longer has a size difference between hierarchies. 

Place the decimal material on the appropriate felt squares: 1000 cube on green, 100 square on red, 10 bar on blue, and 1 bead on green.

Then, place the 1000, 100, 10, and 1 stamps under the corresponding decimal material.

“Now, instead of golden beads, we will be using these stamps. This is 1000. This is 100. This is 10. This is 1. You can see that the number is written on the stamp.”

Then, do a three-period lesson.

**Presentation II:  Static Addition**
1. Refer to the equation, whether it is composed with wooden numeral cards or an equation on paper. Ask the child to read the equation. “Now, I will show you how we can use the stamp game material to find out what these quantities make when they are joined together – when we add them together.”

2. Point to the first number. Read it. As you repeat the number, collect the quantity of stamps and place the stamps on the table in a column..  “_____ thousand…” Then place the thousand stamps. “____ hundred.” Then, place the hundred stamps. Etc.

(NOTE: Consider using a 5 frame layout when placing the stamps.)

3. Then, place the separation object below the first number’s set of stamps. Pencil, dowel, string, strip of felt…

4. Point to the second number. Read it. As you repeat the number, collect the quantity of stamps and place the stamps on the table.  “_____ thousand…” Then place the thousand stamps. “____ hundred.” Then, place the hundred stamps. Etc.

5. “Now, we will combine these quantities to see how much we have all together.” 
“When we combine quantities, we always start with the units.”

6. Slide the unit stamps to the edge of the table. If using the 5 frame layout, move the units in groups of five to the edge of the table in columns of five that are right next to each other.

7. Count the units by subitizing / perceptualizing or counting by ones - depending on the experience of the child. Slide the units into your subdominant hand, grasping them in a fist.

8. Declare the total number of units, “____ units!” and then record the number of units on the equation paper or retrieve the appropriate large numeral card. Return the recorded stamps to the compartment in the box.

9. Continue with the other hierarchies, repeating step 8.

10. Read the equation (“number story”) with the child.

**Points of Interest:**
* Color, size, shape of stamps
* Moving the stamps around – clicking, sliding
* New material but a familiar operation

**Control of Error:**
* Accurate observation by teacher to determine child’s readiness
* Visual – seeing quantities and symbols do not match
* Auditory – hearing the correct language given by the teacher

**Variations:**
* Work with two children – giving each one addend
* Prepared problems should eventually replace numeral cards
* Combine more than two addends

**Extensions:**\
Dynamic addition with stamp game

**Vocabulary:**
* Stamp Game
* Stamps

1. Refer to the equation, whether it is composed with wooden numeral cards or an equation on paper. Ask the child to read the equation. “Now, I will show you how we can use the stamp game material to find out what these quantities make when they are joined together – when we add them together.”

2. Point to the first number. Read it. As you repeat the number, collect the quantity of stamps and place the stamps on the table in a column..  “_____ thousand…” Then place the thousand stamps. “____ hundred.” Then, place the hundred stamps. Etc.

(NOTE: Consider using a 5 frame layout.)

3. Then, place the separation object below the first number’s set of stamps. Pencil, dowel, string, strip of felt…

4. Point to the second number. Read it. As you repeat the number, collect the quantity of stamps and place the stamps on the table.  “_____ thousand…” Then place the thousand stamps. “____ hundred.” Then, place the hundred stamps. Etc.

5. “Now, we will combine these quantities to see how much we have all together.” 
“When we combine quantities, we always start with the units.”

6. Slide the unit stamps to the edge of the table. If using the 5 frame layout, move the units in groups of five to the edge of the table in columns of five that are right next to each other.

7. Count the units by subitizing / perceptualizing / counting by fives or counting by ones - depending on the experience of the child. “Remember, when you get to ten, you need to stop, and exchange.”

8. Whenever the quantity of stamps counted into the hand reaches ten, it is time to exchange. Declare the total number of units, “10 units!” “I need to exchange.” Perform a two-handed exchange: at the same time, drop the ten unit stamps into the unit compartment with one hand and pick up one 10 stamp with the other. 

Place the new 10 stamp at the bottom of the table in the tens column where the other 10 stamps will be combined.

9. Record the number of units remaining on the equation paper or retrieve the appropriate large numeral card.

10. Continue with the tens. Combine the ten stamps at the edge of the table. Exchange for a 100 stamp when ten 10 stamps are gathered. Record the quantity of remaining 10 stamps. Complete the same process for the 100s and 1000s.

**Points of Interest:**
* Color, size, shape of stamps
* Moving the stamps around – clicking, sliding
* New material but a familiar operation

**Control of Error:**
* Accurate observation by teacher to determine child’s readiness
* Visual – seeing quantities and symbols do not match
* Auditory – hearing the correct language given by the teacher

**Variations:**
* Work with two children – giving each one addend
* Prepared problems should eventually replace numeral cards
* Combine more than two addends

**Extensions:**\
Dynamic addition with stamp game

**Vocabulary:**
* Stamp Game
* Stamps

### Bead Frame - Addition

{{< img class="float-right" src="/img/math/addition/image024.webp" alt="Bead Frame" >}}

**Materials:**
* Small bead frame
* Bead frame paper 
* Green, blue, and red pencils

**Prerequisites:**
* Addition with stamp game and other materials
* Reading numbers
* Reading equations
* Coordination, concentration, order

**Direct Aim:**
* Use more abstract material for addition
* Reinforce place value in the decimal system

**Indirect Aim:**
* To develop an understanding of the standard algorithm for exchanging in dynamic addition
* To prepare for abstract computation
* To support mathematical mind development

**Age:** 5.5-6 years

**Presentation:**\
**Transition Lesson:**
Show the child that this material is now becoming even more abstract. Hold the stamp from each hierarchy in the stamp game (in turn) next to the corresponding number and beads on the bead frame. 

**Presentation 2:  practice building numbers and writing on the bead frame paper**
1. Show the bead frame to the child, pointing out the numerals along the left side of the frame. Ask the child to slide beads over, one at a time, starting with the ones. Each move should be recorded on the bead frame paper. This will give the child practice moving the beads and recording on the bead frame paper.

2. Ask the child to close his/her eyes while you move beads to form a number. Ask the child to record the moved quantities and then read the recorded number. 

3. Then, write down a number and ask the child to move the beads accordingly.

4. When these skills are mastered, the child is ready for Presentation 2.

**Presentation 3: Static Addition with Bead Frame**
1. Move all the beads to the left side of the bead frame. Review the bead frame paper with the child. Numbers are written on top of the colored lines.

2. Select a static problem and record it on the bead frame paper.

3. Work with one number/addend at a time. Keep the pointer finger from the subdominant hand pointing to the number that corresponds with the beads being moved. The other hand is holding a pencil that will move the beads. Use the pencil’s point to slide the beads one at a time all the way to the right of the frame.

4. Start with the units – the top wire. With subdominant hand, point to the unit number of the first addend. Slide the quantity related to the first addend’s units, to the right. Then move your subdominant pointer finger to the second addend’s unit quantity and slide that quantity of beads to the right to join the beads from the first addend.

5. Count, subitize, or perceptualize the total quantity of unit beads. Record the total on the bead frame paper.

6. Repeat step 4 and 5 for the tens, hundreds, and thousands.

7. Read the equation.

**Presentation 4: Dynamic Addition with Bead Frame**
1. Follow the same procedure as static addition, until an exchange needs to happen because ten is reached.

2. To execute an exchange, when the tenth bead is moved to right (for any order) say “Exchaaaange” as you slide all ten beads from the lower order back to the left side of frame and then immediately slide one bead from the next highest order to the right, and then immediately continue the count where you left off. For example, for 6 + 6 units, first move over six beads. Then, start to count the second six beads like this, “One, two, three, four. Exchaaaange! (slide the 10 green units to the left and slide one blue ten bead to the right) five, six.” 

3. Continue in the same way for the 10s, 100s, and 1000s.

**Points of Interest:**
* Sliding the beads with the point of a pencil
* Using a new material with a familiar process
* Working to complete equations quickly – especially when exchanging

**Control of Error:**
* Accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness
* Visual – seeing the number of beads moved, or remaining, doesn’t make sense

**Extensions:**
* Large Bead Frame Material
* Memorize addition facts

**Vocabulary:**\
Bead Frame

### Working Charts - Addition

**Materials:**
* Chart 1:  Addition Fact Chart contains 81 basic addition facts: 1+1 to 9+9. It is used as a control chart to check work. 
* Chart 2:  Commutative Law Chart displays only the facts needed when the commutative law is applied - 45 addition facts. All the facts are arranged so that all the combinations with the same sum are in the same horizontal row.
* Chart 3:  Addition Finger Chart is used to aid memorization of the addition facts. The addends 0 to 9 are shown across the top in blue and down the left edge in red. Sums for math fact combinations are displayed where the row and column intersect. 
* Chart 4:  Half Chart of Chart 3 removes duplicates. The addends 1 to 9 are printed in red squares down the left column. No other addends are printed on the chart.
* Chart 5:  Doubles Chart - addends 1-9 are printed down the left in red. Each row extends out to the double of the addend. Not all numerals are printed. Only the number that is double the addend and the numeral before that are displayed.
* Chart 6: Blind Chart – same as Chart 3 except the sums are not shown. Numeral tiles are used to cover the squares.
* Loose equation combinations, paper slips and lead pencil, and numeral Tiles for Chart 5
* Red Pencil (erasable) for child written (or photocopied) chart or a Red Dry Erase Marker for sealed wooden chart or laminated chart
* Paper for equations
* Blank grid that is used with Chart 1 and Chart 2

**Age:** 5 – 6 years


#### Addition Chart I – 81 Basic Facts


{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/math/addition/image031.webp" alt="Working Charts 1 Addition" >}}


**Presentation for Chart I:**\
**NOTE:** Before this presentation, this chart should have been used by the child as an “answer key” to check single digit equation work. Remember, when the chart is used in this way, it should be placed a distance from the child. The child walks to the chart, finds the answer, and then holds the equation and answer in his/her mind during the walk back to the work area. This is one way the older children begin to experience the idea that math facts may simply be remembered. The “brain” can be seen as a tool/material. 



**Chart I and the Passage from Chart I to Chart II:**
1. Ask the child to copy all the addition facts from Chart 1 onto the provided paper. (Paper should appear as Chart 1 but without the equations. It can be made easily using the table building function in Microsoft Word, landscape, legal size paper OR ledger size paper.)

2. “You created a chart with the 81 addition math facts it is important to know.” “I can show you a way to save a lot of time – you will only need to learn half!”

3. “Let’s get started.” Read the first fact. “1 + 1 = 2.” (Pause and examine the paper.) “That is true, and there is no other fact on the board like that one. So, this fact must remain here. It stays.”

4. Move DOWN the chart and continue reading: “1 + 2 = 3. Point to 2 + 1 = 3 in the next column. Hmmm. They are the same, so we can eliminate one. (Cross out 2+1=3 with the red pencil, or cover with a pink slip of paper.)

5. Continue DOWN the first column and read “1 + 3 = 4.  Here, I see 4 again. (point) 3 + 1 = 4. Hmmm. So, THESE are the same too. You can see that 1 + 3 = 4 and 3 + 1 = 4, so, we can eliminate the second one.” (Cross out 3 + 1 = 4 with the red pencil, or cover with a pink slip of paper.) “Do we see any more duplicates of 1+3?” (Move your finger across the rows – scanning for duplicate equations.) “No. So, we’ll go on to the next one.” (Slide your finger down to 1 + 4 = 5.)

6. Here, you could ask the child to identify the duplicate equation for which you are searching. It may sound like this: “Next, we have 1 + 4 = 5. So, what are we looking for? What will the duplicate equation look like? What will we need to eliminate?” The child should say, “4 + 1 = 5,” and this will provide positive assessment information.

**NOTE:** Crossing off with an ERASEABLE red pencil works well. The pink paper slips tend to move around. The paper with crossed-off equations is also easier to “pause” until the next day. If slips of paper are used, consider using the smallest size Post-It Notes that are available in a variety of colors, including pink. There are two advantages to Post-It slips. First, the slips of paper have adhesive on one edge so they won’t move around, and second, if the child makes an error, (when you leave them to complete the process independently) it is easy to adjust/correct. Of course, the size of the small Post– It Notes should be considered when creating the empty table so they fit nicely in the equation cells. A red pencil is also easier on the classroom budget.




#### Addition Chart II – Commutative Property

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/math/addition/image032.webp" alt="Working Charts 2 Addition" >}}


**Presentation for Chart II**

1. After the child creates a chart based on the commutative property by crossing out all duplicate equations on Chart I, show them Chart II – which is the result of this work.

2. Complete an assessment exercise by asking the child to find facts that do not appear on Chart II, such as “8 + 5” or “9 + 6´or “5 + 3.” The unlisted duplicate equation should be provided to the child in written form and the teacher should read it with the child. The child should recognize that 5 + 8 is a duplicate of 8 + 5. This will add other piece of assessment information for the teacher. “Use this chart and tell me the answer to this equation (show them written equation) eight plus five – eight joined together with five.”

3. Provide several opportunities to use Chart II and to apply an understanding of the commutative property to complete equations.



#### Addition Chart III – Addition Finger Chart (FIRST)

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/math/addition/image033.webp" alt="Working Charts 3 Addition" >}}

**Presentation for Chart III:**

1. Child selects an individual addition problem. (This can be from a provided table of addition fact equations on a page or in a booklet, loose slips of equation papers prepared and ready for the child to enter the product, or from equations copied from tiles in the tiles in the equation box.)

2. After saying the equation out loud, the child places the left hand’s pointer finger on the vertical, red addend strip and the right hand’s pointer finger on the horizontal, blue addend strip. 

3. Move the left finger across, being careful to stay in the same row. Move the right finger down, being sure to stay in the same column. The cell at which the fingers intersect is the answer – the “sum.”

4. To encourage memorization, the chart and the equation paper/recording paper could be in different areas of the room. This will require the child to hold the equation and sum in his/her mind while walking back to the table with the multiplication table paper and pencil.


#### Addition Chart IV – Half Chart

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/math/addition/image034.webp" alt="Working Charts 4 Addition" >}}


**Presentation for Chart IV:**

1. Child selects an individual addition problem. 

2.  Both addends are located on the vertical red strip. Place left pointer finger on the smaller addend, and the right pointer finger on the larger addend. BOTH fingers are on the red strip. The smaller number “goes first” and this will always be the number closest to the top of the board.

3. Move the finger on the smaller number all the way to the end of its row – so as far to the right as possible. Keep it there…

4. Now, move the other finger (on the greater number) to the right in its row but stop in the column also occupied by the other finger. This (greater number) finger is now resting on the resulting product of the two factors – the answer.


#### Addition Chart V

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/math/addition/image035.webp" alt="Working Charts 5 Addition" >}}



**Presentation for Chart V**

1. Select a problem with two even OR two odd addends.

2. Place the left pointer finder on the lesser addend and the right pointer finger on the greater addend.

3. Slide both fingers to the end of their respective rows. 

4. Then, slide/hop the fingers diagonally toward each other, one box at a time until they meet – that is the sum. They will meet in the same box when completing their final hop.

5. When using one odd and one even addend, complete steps 1-3 EXCEPT the fingers will not end up meeting in the same box after hopping on the diagonal. The top finger will need to move down one box and the bottom finger will need to move to the left one box to reach the sum.



#### Addition Chart VI – Blind Chart

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/math/addition/image036.webp" alt="Working Charts 6 Addition" >}}


**Presentation for Chart VI**

1. Retrieve the number tile box that accompanies this chart. Remove all the tiles from the box and sort them on the table top in sequence. The child may sort tiles, one by one, as the tile is removed from the box. The arrangement will look like this:

{{< figure class="pure-img" src="/img/math/addition/image037.webp" alt="Working Charts 7 Addition" caption="(image from revised Xavier album)" >}}

2. Select an equation and read it out loud, “Four plus three equals what?” The child then uses the same finger movements as completed when using Chart 3 and mentally calculates the sum.

3. Find and place the correct tile on the board.

4. If the child does not know the sum, then Chart 3 may be placed across the room, and the child may go to that chart to determine which tile needs to be placed on the board.

**Points of Interest:**
* Sliding and hopping fingers
* Remembering equations/sums
* Finding patterns

**Control of Error:**\
Accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness

**Extensions:**
Instead of selecting the equation first and then placing the tile, the child selects the tile first and then places on the board in one of the appropriate coordinates

### The Dot Game

**Prerequisites:** Addition and Subtraction with Golden Bead, Addition and Subtraction Stamp Game.

**Age:** 6

**Direct Aim:** To further stress place value after the Stamp Game with these operations.

**Indirect Aim:** To prepare for bead frame lessons, moving into more abstract use of addition and subtraction.

**Control of Error:** The dots on the paper or board.

**Point of Interest:**  The board and colored markers or pencils.

**Materials:**  Dot Game paper or board, red, blue and green markers or pencils

**Follow-up:** 1. Student design addition and subtraction problems.

**Presentation of Addition:**
1. Write an addition problem in the blank or grid space to the right side of the problem space. The problem should have up to 9 addends. This is column addition.

2. Use the green pencil to record the column of units. Place a green dot inside a small square for each of the units in the addends.  Draw a line through each complete row of ten units and represent those ten units with one blue dot in the tens column. Say: “When we have ten units, we mark them out and carry over a ten to the tens column.”

3. Repeat this process for the tens, hundreds and thousands.

4. Count the number of dots remaining in the units column and record that number in the space provided at the bottom for the sum (answer). Repeat this process for the tens, hundreds, and thousands.

5. Read the answer across the bottom of the special paper. Record the answer below the problem on the right side of the addends.
