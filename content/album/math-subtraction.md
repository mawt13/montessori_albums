> “The idea that needs to be emphasized – and it is a characteristic of subtraction – is the existence of only one real quantity.” 

> “With regard to the transformation of numerical quantities between orders, we know that ten units of an order merge into a single unit of the next higher order. Here in subtraction, we further note that one unit of a higher order can be divided into 10 of the next lower order. It is, however, the same game around 10 whether units are joined or separated.”

> From Maria Montessori’s Psychoarithmetic: Arithmetic developed under the guidelines of child psychology


NOTE: The larger number from which smaller number is subtracted is called the minuend. The smaller number which is subtracted is called subtrahend. The answer is the difference.

## Subtraction with the Golden Bead Material

**Materials:**
* Golden Bead Material
* Two sets of small numeral cards
* One set of large numeral cards
* “-“and “=” signs
* Trays
* Two rugs and a table

**Prerequisites:**
* Addition with golden bead material
* Introductory subtraction activities (loose objects)
* Prior work with decimal system including number composition

**Direct Aim:**
* Experience with the concrete representation of the process of subtraction
* Understand when/how to use the subtraction symbol – minus sign

**Indirect Aim:**
* Adequate experience and repetition to discover the relationship between addition and subtraction
* Exposure to idea that the process of subtraction allows quantities to be compared

**Age:** 4.5 – 5 years

**Presentation I – Static Subtraction**
1. Lay out the large numeral cards for the minuend vertically on a work rug – 1000s at the top. Use one of the small numeral card boxes to supply the numeral cards for the subtrahend – these should be placed on one of the trays.

2. Hand the child the other (empty) tray and ask them to retrieve the gold for the minuend and arrange it next to the large numeral cards on the rug.

3. “The numerals on this tray tell me how much gold I need to take away from this large amount of gold.”  “I will place it on the tray starting with the ones.” Collect the required gold and place it on the tray next to the associated numeral. 

“When we read a number, we start with the thousands, when we work with a number, we start with the ones.”

4. When the tray contains all the gold for the subtrahend, say, “Take it away!” and move your arm through the air in a slicing motion to indicate a direction to the other rug where the tray is to be placed. The child should compose the number and read it. The gold, numeral cards and tray stay on that rug.

5. When the child returns to the main rug, empty handed, say, “Hmmm. I wonder how much we have left after that part of this large amount was taken away?”  “Let’s organize this remaining gold and find out!”

6. Compose the large number cards. “We will save these here to remember what we started with when we write the number story.”

7. Start with the ones.

“When we read a number, we start with the thousands, when we work with a number, we start with the ones.”

Count the quantity in each hierarchy and retrieve the corresponding small number card. Place the card next to the gold. Compose that number – the remaining amount – the difference.

8. “Now we can write the number story.” Retrieve a golden bead equation paper. “We started with this large amount.” (Read the number & write the number – fill whole square with the number.) “Then, we took that (point) gold away.” (Walk to the other rug and read & write that number – about half the size of the square.) “And, we had this much left.” (Walk back to the main rug and read & write that number – about half the size of the square.)

9. “We need to put the sign here that lets people know that we took away this amount.” Show the child where to write the minus sign.

**Presentation II – Dynamic Subtraction**

Step 3 from Presentation I is where this Presentation about dynamic subtraction varies because the child will need to exchange in order to successfully retrieve the required gold quantities to place on the ”take away” tray.

1. As each hierarchy on the subtrahend tray is considered, ask, “Do we have enough here (point) to remove “x” and put it on our tray? ‘NO?’” 

“We need more (ones). How will we get them? We need to exchange!” 

NOTE: This child should have worked with the exchange game and dynamic addition and multiplication problems so should know what this means. 

2. Go with the child to the gold source and exchange a ten bar from the minuend for ten ones. Bring the ten ones back to the rug and place them with the other ones of the minuend. 

3. “Now do we have enough to take away ___ ones?” Child says, “Yes.” Then, remove the indicated amount and place on the subtrahend tray. 

4. Continue on to the next hierarchy. “Do we have enough tens to remove___ tens and put them on our tray? ‘No?’“  

 “We will need to get some more tens. How will we do that? We need to exchange again!” Go with the child and exchange one hundred from the minuend for ten ten bars.

5. Continue this for the hundreds.

6. Perform Steps 8 and 9 from Presentation I to record the equation.

**Presentation III – Zeros in the Minuend**

NOTE: Before presenting this lesson, the child should have a great deal of experience with dynamic equations.

The equation for the initial exposure to zero in the minuend should contain many zeros in the minuend – 3000, 4000, 5000 etc.

Presentation IV – rejoin the subtrahend and difference to recreate the minuend
“I wonder if we will still have this amount (point to the composed minuend number) if we bring back the gold we took away and join it with the gold we had left?”

“Do you want to find out?”  “What would you guess?”

**Points of Interest**
* Performing a new task with a familiar work
* Movement of “taking away” 
* Discovering the relationship between subtraction and addition

**Control of Error**
* Accurate observation & assessment by teacher to determine true readiness
* Noticing if quantity and symbol do not align
* Hearing the correct language when reading the equation
* Variations

**Extensions**
* Move on to stamp game
* Move on to strip board

**NOTE:** In Maria Montessori’s Psychoarithmetic, she describes using “token” cards to represent the subtrahend amount. She also suggests, “The subtraction operation could be represented as the splitting of a single original quantity into two quantities…” This is a different perspective than “take away.”

## Subtraction with Stamp Game

**Materials**\
Stamp game material

**Prerequisites**
* Subtraction with golden bead material
* Other subtraction activities
* Understanding of “-“ sign

**Direct Aim**
* Experience with subtraction – static and dynamic
* Move toward abstraction

**Indirect Aim**
Prepare for future division problems

**Age:** 5 - 5.5 years

**Presentation**\
**Presentation I – Static Subtraction**
1. Orient child to stamp game material. Remind child about subtraction work they did with other materials.

2. Retrieve a given problem that will not require exchanging. The child lays out the stamps on the table (mat/rug) using the same approach they learned doing addition with the golden bead material. (Consider using five frame/ten frame approach.)

3. “With this material, the stamp game, when we separate out and remove some of the stamps, we put them back in the box.” (“When we did a subtraction equation like this with the golden bead material we put the separated-out gold on a tray and said, ‘Take it away!’”)

4. “Let’s get started!” Read the entire problem to the child. (Then, point to the ones numeral in the subtrahend that needs to be taken away.) 

“It says we need to start by removing _____ ones.” Count that quantity into your subdominant hand and then put those stamps back in the stamp game box.

5. Record what happened on the equation sheet.

 (pointing) “We had ______ and then I removed/took away ______ and put them back in the box. _______.” (pantomime this)

“After removing ______ we have ______ ones left. I will record that here in the ones place.” 

Then, write down the number of ones that are left on the equation  paper.

6. Continue with remaining hierarchies.


**Presentation II – Dynamic Subtraction**

1. Complete the steps as outlined in Static Subtraction. 

2. If an exchange is required because you don’t have enough in that hierarchy to remove the indicated subtrahend quantity say, “It says we need to remove _____, but we have a problem. There aren’t enough (ones) for us to take away that many. We need some more ones! Where can we get some more ones?”

3. Child should say, “We need to exchange a ten,” because that is what they did with golden beads. If they don’t remember, tell them. “We will exchange this ten (separate out one ten stamp) for 10 ones.” 

**NOTE:** the ten stamp that is being exchanged for ten ones can slide over to the top of the ones column right up against the box so it is clear it is waiting for the exchange to happen.
 
**EXCHANGE PROCESS:** “I will get the ones we will need. Then we will do the exchange.”
Now, count ten ones into your subdominant hand. “Okay. We are ready to do the two-handed exchange. Remember, we ALWAYS exchange using TWO hands.”  “This hand has the ones (show closed fist) and this hand has the 10.” (pick up the 10 stamp that was separated out) “Ready? One, two, three, EXCHAAAANGE.” Drop the 10 stamp into the box exactly at the same time you place the 10 one stamps onto the table in a little pile. Then arrange the one stamps (using a 10 frame approach).

4. Record what happened. “We finished working with the ones so I will record what happened here in the ones place.” (pointing) We started with ______ and I removed the ____, and now we have _____ left.”

5. Continue with the other hierarchies. When finished, read the “number story.”

**Points of Interest**
* Manipulating with the stamps
* New way to complete a familiar operation
* Performing exchange when needed

**Control of Error**\
Accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness

**Extensions**\
Invite a child to be the banker for the exchanges

## Subtraction Strip Board

**Material**
* Subtraction strip board – squares arranged in a grid of 18 columns and 12 rows
* Red strips 1-9 and Blue strips 1-9
* Natural wood strips – 17 blanks
* Subtraction Chart 1 used as a control to check answers
* Prepared equation slips or equation tables

**Prerequisites**
* Subtraction with the golden bead material
* Addition strip board
* Reading and writing equations
* Gradation activities

**Direct Aim**
* Practice finding the difference between quantities using the subtraction strip board
* To learn subtraction facts in a concrete way

**Indirect Aim**
* To prepare for abstract computation of subtraction
* To develop accuracy

**Age** 5-5.5 years

**Presentation I**\
(Uses only the red strips and longest natural wood strip and focuses on 10 as minuend.)

1. Invite the child to participate in the lesson. Bring the materials to a rug.

2. Invite the child to place the red strips to the right of the board, in graded sequence, with nine at the top and one at the bottom.

3. Invite the child to place the longest natural strip across the top of the board, covering all numerals greater than 10.

{{< img class="float-right" src="/img/math/subtraction/image009.webp" alt="Subtraction Strip Board" >}}

4. Say, “I wonder what would be left if started with 10 (point to the 10) and then took three away?” (Retrieve the red 3 strip and hold it up so the child can see it.)

**NOTE:** If the classroom has a set of 17 natural wood strips and will be using Presentation III, then use the blue strips for the subtrahend here to be consistent with Presentation III.

Place the red 3 strip to the left of the natural strip, end to end, so that the red strip covers the numerals 10, 9, and 8 across the top of the board.

5. Point to the 7 on top of the board and repeat the equation, inserting the answer, “Ten, take away three, is seven.” Or “We started with 10 and then took away three, and we have seven left.”

6. Repeat this process, taking other numbers away from 10. When the child is ready, repeat using different minuends other than 10. You accomplish this by placing the natural strip over different numerals, greater than 8.

**Presentation II**\
(Introduces recording the equation and answer on paper.)

1. Repeat the first presentation and ask the child to record the equations – the “number story.”

2. Prepared equation tables may also be used.

3. Show the child how to use Subtraction Chart 1 as a control to check answers. This chart should be placed across the room from the child to encourage holding the equation and corresponding answer “in the mind” while walking between the chart and equation paper. This begins the act of memorization and allows the child to experience this process.

{{< img class="float-right" src="/img/math/subtraction/image011.webp" alt="Subtraction Strip Board" >}}

**Presentation III is a variation**\
(Uses set of 17 natural wood blanks and both the blue strips and red strips)

1. Use vertical layout of blanks. Be sure the longest blank is exactly above the 1 square.

The set-up of the blue and red strips may vary according to classroom practice (starting with nine on top or with one on top) but this won’t impact the equation’s outcome. However, the blue strips should be on the left and the red strips should be on the right.

2. For the problem shown, 15 - 8 = , the pointer finger slides over to the minuend number (15) at the top of the board. Then push the blank above the 15 up a little and retrieve it to cover the numbers starting from the right (16,17,18) because these numbers don’t factor into the equation. Now, the board is ready with the minuend amount displayed for this particular equation.

{{< img class="float-right" src="/img/math/subtraction/image012.webp" alt="Subtraction Strip Board" >}}

3. Use the blue strips for the subtrahend. Place it exactly to the left of the blank. 

Point to the first number visible next to the blue strip – that is the difference/the answer: “We started with 15 and took away 8 and now we have 7 left.” 

“7 is the answer and we call this the difference.”


4. It is also possible to emphasize the difference by laying out the red strip and counting the sections with the child.

Point the the appropriate spot on the board as you say, “This shows us what is left, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. If you have 15 and take 8 away, then you have 7 left.”

{{< img class="float-right" src="/img/math/subtraction/image013.webp" alt="Subtraction Strip Board" >}}


**Points of Interest**
* Similar to the Addition Strip Board
* Using the natural wood strip to hide numbers
* See subtraction in a different way
* Remembering math facts

**Control of Error**
* Accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness
* Visual – noticing that the strips do not match what is recording on paper
* Auditory – hearing the correct language when reading the equation

**Variations**\
Presentation III is a variation for this material. If it is used in your classroom then consider using the blue strips for the subtrahend in Presentation I so presentations are consistent.

**Extensions**\
Subtraction Charts

**Vocabulary**\
Minuend, Subtrahend, Difference

## Subtraction Working Charts

**Materials**
* Chart I – Subtraction facts from 18-9= ___ to 1-1=___.
* Chart II – Numerals arranged in a parallelogram. The top (red/orange) row is the minuend. The column along the left is the subtrahend. All squares are filled contain numbers.
* Chart III – Same as Chart II but the squares are blank. This is used with a green box of tiles used to fill the blank squares.
* Box containing all the subtraction problems printed on small slips of paper or pieces of plastic/wood.

**Prerequisites**\
Experience with early subtraction materials

**Direct Aim**\
Practice math tables

**Indirect Aim**
* Move toward abstraction 
* Begin to memorize some subtraction facts

**Age:** 5.5 years

**Presentation**\

### Presentation – Chart I

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/math/subtraction/image014.webp" alt="Subtraction Working Charts" >}}


Show the child how Chart I may be used as a control chart.


### Presentation – Chart II

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/math/subtraction/image015.webp" alt="Subtraction Working Charts" >}}


**Chart II Presentation**
1. Retrieve Chart II, its box of equations, and blank paper to a table. Take out an equation and read it. The child should write the equation on blank paper. 16 -6 =___

2. Place the right index finger on the minuend (16) and the left index finger on the subtrahend.

3. Move the fingers as done for Addition Chart III – moving the right finger down until it is horizontal to the left finger. Then, bring the left finger over to meet it.

4. This is the answer. Invite the child to record the answer.

5. Continue with more equations.

6. Show child how to check the equation using Chart I as a control chart.


### Presentation – Chart III

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/math/subtraction/image016.webp" alt="Subtraction Working Charts" >}}


**Presentation Chart III**
1. Retrieve Chart III, the box of equations, and the box of answer tiles and take them to a table. Sort and arrange the tiles into a square above the chart. There should be ten tiles of each numeral, 0 to 9.

2. Select an equation and read it:  16-6=___., for example. 

Ask the child to locate the answer among the tiles and use the same finger movements as in the Chart II presentation to locate the corresponding square on the chart.

3. The work continues until all the tiles are used. Chart II can serve as a control chart.

**Points of Interest**
* Placing the tiles on the board
* Moving fingers to find correct square
* Identifying patterns

**Control of Error**
* Accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness
* Visual observation that tiles to not fit

## Negative Snake Game

**Materials:**
* The negative snake game materials, which consist of a box with eight sets of the colored bead bars from one to nine
* The black and white bead stair
* A box of golden bead bars (ten bead bars)
* A notched counter
* A box of gray bead bars

**Prerequisites:** work with the colored bead stair, bead bar addition, positive snake game, bead bar subtraction

**Direct Aim:** To subtract with the bead stair, to memorize subtraction facts resulting in the differences of 1-9

**Indirect Aim:** To continue developing order, concentration, coordination, and independence, to explore subtraction with the snake game

**Age:** 5-6 years

**Presentation:**
1. Set up a work area with a smaller rug/mat on a table
2. Retrieve the set of negative snake game materials 
3. Remove the black and white bead bars and arrange them in order from 10 down to 1 at the top right corner of the small table rug
4. State, “I’m going to make a beautiful, colorful snake.”  Begin making a colorful snake.  
5. Select the gray bead bars, explaining they mean we have to subtract, or take away, just like we wish grey clouds might go away.  
6. Place the grey bead bars between the colored beads.  
7. Add the colored bead bars.
8. Once you get to a grey bead bar, stop and say, “Now I need to subtract this amount.” Determine the value of the grey beads just as you determine the value of the black and white bead bars.
9. Subtract the amount of grey beads, utilizing the notched counter as you count in the opposite direction (right to left) how many beads are on the grey bar.  Place the notch of the counter in a place if a black and bead bar is required.
10. State the subtraction fact discovered.  
11. Place any bead bars you remove from the snake into a small container on the side, to be used for verification later.
12. Continue making exchanges for golden bead bars whenever you reach 10, leaving the notched counter in its place, with remaining beads from that particular bead bar being a black and white place holder, then continuing counting from the notched marker to the next 10, exchanging that for a golden bead bar, etc.  Whenever you reach a grey bead bar, continue counting that many to the left, leaving the notched counter there and utilizing the remainder bead bars when needed and removing the necessary bead bars.  Eventually, the snake will either be composed entirely of golden beads (especially for the first presentation), but eventually a remainder will be left.  For the remainder, utilize the black and white bead bars.
13. Verify that you have counted correctly by checking the bead bars you have taken from the chain along with the grey bead bars that signaled a subtraction needed to be made.  You could create two snakes with these, the colored one above, the grey one below, to check that they match.  Be sure to do this work in a separate space so as not to get it mixed up with the other snake which is the difference.  
14. Now match the colored bead bars that you removed from the snake to the snake you have that represents the difference between the minuend (the larger number) and the subtrahend (the number taken away/subtracted from the minuend).

**Points of Interest:**\
The snake becomes shorter and shorter as the child continues to subtract, discovering the remainder after taking away/subtracting

**Control of Error:**\
Utilize the bead bars you take away as well as the grey subtraction beads to verify that you have subtracted the correct amount.  The guide is also the control of error.  In addition, consider having control cards for all subtraction problems you give a child with the snake game.

**Extensions:**\
As children become more familiar with the negative snake game, you can continue to give them more challenging snakes to work with.  At first, you may want to have the child not have to utilize the black and white bead bars to hold the place.  Eventually, you can have the child record their work/draw what they did in a work journal.

**Vocabulary:**\
Minuend is the larger quantity that you start with, the subtrahend is the quantity you subtract, the difference is what remains.
