### Division with Golden Bead Material

**Materials**
* Golden Bead Material
* Division problems that suit the lesson (no remainder or, for dynamic, a remainder)
* Multiple children – three works well
* Each child has a rug or tray for their “share” of the gold
* Teacher has a rug to hold quantity to be divided – “shared out”

**Prerequisites**
* Practical life work that requires sharing out
* Experiences at group time with sharing out
* Exchanging
* Introduction to the division sign

**Direct Aim**
* Experience dividing a given quantity into equal squares
* Experience exchanging a given hierarchy into a smaller hierarchy to continue dividing

**Indirect Aim**
* Preparation for division with multi-digit divisors
* Experience with required flexible thinking because division work begins with the 1000s – not Is

**Age:** 5.5 - 6

**Presentation**

**Presentation I – static division**

ALWAYS BEGIN WITH THE THOUSANDS WHEN WORKING A DIVISION PROBLEM.

**Note:** This is easily perceived if done with a group of three children and each child has his/her own small rug. This is distributive division. Division as repeated subtraction comes later.

1. Make an equation at the bottom of the rug, using the large cards for the dividend, the small cards for the divisor, and the signs: ÷   = . (Or, use prepared equations.)

2. Place needed (divisor) trays at various locations on the rug. Explain that these mark the three sets that will be formed.

3. Have the child take out the correct number of golden bead material to make 6936, and place them on the left of the rug.

4. Have the child begin with the thousands and distribute them evenly to all three trays. Then, the child should continue distributing the hundreds, the tens, and the ones.  (Note:  The illustration shows a vertical placement of the distribution; the placement of the skittles could also be horizontal.)

5. Have the child count the golden bead material on one tray and verify that each skittle received the same amount and form the quotient with the small cards.

6. Form the entire equation at the bottom of the rug, and have the child read it.

7. “The answer in division is what each one gets.”

**Presentation II – dynamic division**
1. Follow the same procedure, beginning with a numeral divisible by 3 but requiring exchange, e.g., 4587.

2. EXCHANGE PROCESS: “Oh, Oh! We need ______ so each one gets the same. We only have _____. So we will need to exchange so we can keep sharing out this gold!” 

3. “We need to exchange this _______ for ten ________.” Take the (100) to the golden bead source and exchange for 10 tens. “Ten tens makes one hundred.”  “Now, we can keep sharing out these ten bars.”

**Presentation III – a remainder**
1. Follow the same steps as the first two presentations but if the quantity is shared out and exchanged as far as it can go, there may be a remainder. Explain to the child.

2. “We shared all the gold. Each one has the same quantity. But, we still have these ____. We can’t share them or some won’t have the same. These are left over. This (one bead) will be called the ‘remainder, and we will put it here.” (Show the child where to place it.)

**Points of Interest**
* Sharing out
* Using the golden beads in a different way

**Control of Error**\
Accurate observation by teacher to determine true readiness

**Variations:** The quantity can be equally distributed to a certain number of students in the class or larger skillets made for the golden beads could be utilized.

**Extensions:** After much time working with the above, when the concepts are solidified, the guide can present one golden bead that needs to be divided into 2.  It’s clear there’s no material for that, and the guide can segue into fractions, which are one whole divided by a certain number.  

**Vocabulary**
* “Division is different. We start with the largest quantity when dividing.  ” 
* Remainder

### Division with Stamp Game

**Materials**
* Stamp game
* Prepared equations or two sets of small numeral cards and one set of large numeral cards
* Division and equal signs

**Prerequisites**\
Division with Golden Bead Material

**Direct Aim**\
Experience dividing a given quantity of stamps into equal sets

**Indirect Aim**
* Move toward abstraction
* Experience with the process of division using more abstract materials

**Age:** 6 – 6.5

**Presentation**\
**Presentation I – Static Division**
1. Write an equation on equation paper, such as 6936 ÷ 3 = ___, or used prepared equations.

2. Place the green skittles next to the stamp game box. Explain that these mark the three sets that will be formed. “We will share out to these three.”  

**NOTE:** Use the green skittles because the divisor is a unit.

3. Ask the child to lay out the correct number of stamps to make 6936 and order the stamps on the edge of the table, leaving a space between stamps and skittles for sharing out.

4. Beginning with the 1000s, distribute the stamps evenly to all three skittles. “One for you, one for you…” then, the child should continue distributing the hundreds, the tens, and the ones.

**NOTE:** Skittles are placed vertically in some environments and horizontally in others.

5. “The answer in division is what each one gets.” Count the quantity received by one of the skittles. Verify that each skittle received the same amount and write the quotient on the equation paper.

6. Ask the child to read the equation.

**Presentation II – Dynamic Division**
1. Follow the same procedure described in Presentation I. Begin with a numeral divisible by 3 but requiring an exchange, such as 4587. Use the same exchanging language used in golden bead dynamic division.

2. When exchanging (one thousand for ten hundreds, for example) identify the thousand that will be exchanged and say, “I am going to exchange this 1000 for 10 hundreds. Ten hundreds makes one thousand.”

3. Then, set the 1000 stamp down on the table very deliberately next to the 100 section of the stamp game box. Count ten 100 stamps in the subdominant hand which is hovering right above the stamp game box’s hundreds compartment.

4. Do not move that hand holding the 10 hundreds stamps until ready for the two-handed exchange. When 10 stamps are in the hand, make a fist around the stamps and say, “Now we are ready for the exchange. One, two, three, exchange!”

5. Then, drop the 1000 stamp in the box at the same time the 100 stamps are released at the bottom of the table.

A two-handed exchange is important.

**Presentation III – with a remainder**

Follow the same procedure but begin with a numeral not evenly divisible by 3, for example, 4589. Use the remainder sign – an r – as done for previous work.

**Points of Interest**
* Using a familiar material in a new way
* Exchanging
* Sharing out

**Control of Error:** the guide or the equation cards with solutions on the back

**Vocabulary:** remainder, dividend, divisor, quotient

### Division Board

**Materials**
* Division Board
* Set of 9 skittles to represent the divisor along the top of the board (green)
* Set of 81 green beads
* Green cup
* Prepared division problems
* Slips of blank paper

**NOTE:** The dividend is the larger number being divided by a smaller number called the divisor. The answer is called the quotient. Any leftover quantity from the dividend after an even distribution is called the remainder.

**Prerequisites**
* Previous experience with division operation
* Experience reading and writing numbers
* Fine motor control

**Direct Aim**
* Experience with the process of division 
* Practice using the division board to find the quotient in basic equations

**Indirect Aim**\
Prepare for memorizing basic division facts

**Age:** 5.5 – 6.5 years

**Presentation:**\
**Presentation I**

1. Select and read an equation, "Eight divided by two equals   	."

2. Ask the child to count out eight green beads into the dividend cup.

3. Ask the child to place two skittles into the first two circular slots at the top of the board – 2 is the divisor.

4. Invite the child to begin distributing beads evenly to each skittle – left to right. When all the beads have been distributed, the child should count how many each skittle received and write the answer on the paper. Distribution is done left to right. Counting to determine the quotient is done top to bottom.

5. “The answer in division is how many each one gets.”  Pick up the first skittle and use it as a counter to tap each bead in its column as it is counted. Ask the child to read the completed equation, "Eight divided by two equals four."

**Presentation II**\
(Shows that not all quantities are evenly divisible by all numbers – remainders exist.)

1. "We're going to do more practice with division, using this board." Remind the child about the rule for division: Everyone gets the same amount. In addition, for this activity, we can't use any answers larger than nine; and we can't have a remainder as large as or larger than the divisor.

2. "We are going to start out with 81 beads." Have the child count them into the cup.

3. Place nine skittles across the top of the board. Have the child write 81 ÷ 9 = on his/her paper. Child distributes beads evenly to skittles, discovering the answer, 9. The child writes the quotient on paper and underlines it in red because the number is evenly divisible.
4. Take away one skittle; and try 81 ÷ 8. Can we re-distribute the beads belonging to that skittle? (No; there is no room.)  Take away one more skittle, trying 81 ÷ 7. (This won't work either, and neither will any smaller divisor.)

5. Take away one bead, “Let's try 80 as a dividend.”  Child gets a new paper from the packet. Return all nine skittles to the board. Begin distributing beads to the skittles. Some cannot be distributed evenly. 80 ÷ 9  = 8, with a remainder of 8. Are any rules broken? (No.) Child records answer - 8 r8.

6. Take away one skittle, forming 80 ÷ 8. There is no room on the board for the beads, since no skittle can receive more than 9. So 80 ÷ 9 is the only equation we can do with a dividend of 80.

7. Child continues with 79, getting a new piece of paper from the packet with each new dividend. This will be able to be worked with a divisors of 9 and 8, but 7 will not be allowed. Child continues with 78 and succeeding numerals. Have the child underline evenly divisible numbers with red.

8. Child continues with succeeding numbers. Answers can be checked using Chart I.

**Presentation III**\
(Further Work)\
When the child has finished the entire second presentation, have him/her get all the division equation papers from where they are stored and locate all those that have an evenly divisible number - they are underlined in red.

The child then makes a long chart organizing all of these. It will look similar to the division chart.	81 ÷ 9 = 9, 72 ÷ 9 = 8, 72 ÷ 8 = 9,64 ÷ 8 = 8, 63 ÷ 9 = 7, 63 ÷ 7 = 9 etc.

**Points of Interest**
* Manipulating skittles and beads
* Saying “One for you, one for you…” because skittles look like people
* Reading the equation

**Control of Error**
* Accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness
* Visual – seeing arrangement of beads complete an array
* Auditory – consistency with what is read and what is on display

**Variations**\
Assign problems with a remainder

**Vocabulary**\
Dividend, divisor, quotient, remainder

### Division Working Charts

**Materials**\
Chart I – Dividends from 81 to 1 are printed across the top against a blue background. Only numbers that can be divided evenly by numbers from 2 to 9 are present. Divisors are along the left of the rows beneath that, starting with the row for 9 and on to a row for 1.

In each row, beneath the appropriate dividend, are printed the quotients. There are blank spaces beneath anything not evenly divided by that divisor.

This chart is used to check answers.

Chart II- This is structured identically to the first chart, but all quotient squares are blank. Numeral tiles are provided for the child to fill in quotients, then check work by using Chart I.

**Prerequisites:** Division with the golden beads, division with the stamp game, division with the division board

**Direct Aim**\
Experience with a material to help learn division tables 1 - 9

**Indirect Aim**\
Prepare for memorization of division facts

**Age:**  6.5 – 7 years

**Presentation**\
**Presentation I**\
With working Chart II, the child sorts and places all the tiles so they are visible, and selects a row, e.g., dividing by 2. Beginning with 18 ÷ 2, the child mentally calculates the answer as 9, finds the 9 tile, and places it in its box/square. Continuing, the child leaves blank those boxes/squares where there is a remainder.
Check work with Chart I.


**Presentation II**\
The child picks any tile, such as 4.  Then, the child identifies a division fact with 4 as the quotient, such as 12 ÷ 3, and places that tile in the proper square on the Chart. Finally, check work with Chart I. 

**Points of Interest**\
Size of the charts

**Control of Error**\
Accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness
