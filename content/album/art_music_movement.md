## Art, Movement, and Music Rational

The aims of the Art, Music, and Movement curriculum in the Montessori primary classroom are similar to/build upon the aims in the practical life and sensorial areas of the classroom.  For instance, all art, music, and movement lessons could also have as their aim order, coordination, concentration, and independence (the same indirect aims for all practical life lessons) and the sensorial materials involve heightening one’s perception of similarities and differences (which the art, music, and movement curriculum connects to as well).  In addition, the aim of the (further) development of a sense of self and a sense of wonder are held in common between the sensorial area of the classroom and the curricular area of art, music, and movement.  The aim of the art, music, and movement album is to provide guides with the guidance and direct instruction to provide children, at which point it is necessary to let the child lead with their own artistic mind (which will develop naturally unless adults interfere).  As guides in the primary classroom, we can provide the materials and lessons on how to work with said materials, from which point the child can take the lead as the artist and musician.

The art, music, and movement lessons in a Montessori classroom all involve the movement of the child’s hand, which Dr. Montessori referred to as the “instrument of man’s intelligence.”  Science has now shown a hand-brain link, which explains why the utilization of one’s hands can help increase one’s understanding.  (Austin Children’s Academy, Feb. 2020). When the guide presents a lesson regarding how to utilize the art or music materials or how to perfect one’s movement and the child focuses on the presentation, the child’s mirror neurons are activated.  According to Mara Daniel at MATEC Web of Conferences; 

> Mirror neurons represent a special category of brain cells, and play a very important role in the direct, automatic and instinctive understanding of the environment. These cortical neurons are activated when we observe how a specific action is performed, not only when we actually carry it out ourselves….. Mirror neurons are highly important when it comes to discern and assimilate other human beings' actions and intentions, and to grasp new skills by mirroring (imitating). They are involved in thought planning and controlling, in abstract thinking and memory. If a child observes an action, the mirror-neurons will activate and form new neural connections, as if he or she undertook the action herself/himself. An efficient functioning of the mirror neurons leads to an excellent development in any field, to a greater emotional intelligence and to a higher level of empathy (Daniel, M, 2017, p. 3).

The overall scope and sequence of the art, music, and movement curriculum is similar to the scope and sequence of other curriculum areas in that lessons progress from simpler, more concrete lessons and materials to increasingly challenging, more abstract lessons and materials, all of which build upon knowledge and skills gained through lessons learned before.  In addition, no prior knowledge/experience is assumed, and all lessons give explicit instruction in the techniques to use the materials.  For drawing work, children progress from pencil and graphite work, to crayon work, to adding texture with crayons, to working with markers, watercolors, and pastels.  Painting work progresses from work with watercolors, to tempera paints, to liquid ink, to acrylic paint.  There are lessons for printmaking, collage, and working with three-dimensional art materials, all progressing from simpler to more complicated materials/mediums with which to explore art.

Music and movement lessons in the Montessori classroom also progress from the simpler to more complex.  For instance, students can learn simple elements of rhythm through first tapping/clapping to the beat prior to then being given rhythm sticks with which to tap the rhythm.  Working with notes/notation can progress from working with one bell to progressing to including the eight bells of the octave. A variety of instruments and musical mediums may be presented to children.  Movement lessons begin with the instruction in moving gracefully on the line, heel to toe, to progressing to increasingly difficult movements with carrying a cup of water while walking the line and attempting to avoid any spills, to eventually carrying a bean bag on top of one’s head, which the child who has worked towards perfecting walking with balance will not drop. In addition, movement activities can progress in difficulty, such as proceeding from walking forwards to galloping to skipping to moving in a grape-vine fashion.

The art, music, and movement curriculum is more open-ended than other areas of the curriculum, but the overarching Montessori components always include following the lead of the child(ren), which can be done only through meticulous observation, and always explicitly teaching all concepts/lessons, such as how to step in a heel-to-toe fashion (regarding a movement lesson).  As the direct aim of lessons become increasingly complex, so too, do the presentations.  Children are taught exactly how to hold the mallet and tap a bell prior to just presenting them with the bell and mallet, as in many play-based classrooms, and children’s true learning is promoted.  So too is their respect for the beautiful art, movement, and music materials as they are able to observe the great care in which the guide handles them and instructs the children in their correct usage. Children are given lessons individually or in small groups regarding how to hold a pencil and various techniques with which to use it, versus expecting children to discover these on their own.

The art featured in eighteen major art museums in the United States consists of 85% of pieces created by White artists, with 87% of those being male artists.  As Montessori guides, our role is to help children be exposed to an equal variety of artists/art representing the plethora of cultures and mediums found in the United States and the world.   When children engage in creating art, they are developing fine motor skills (such as developing their pincer grasp through the way they hold a pencil or paintbrush) as well as improving their own self-awareness and self-control.  Art can help regulate children as it can aid in reducing stress.  In addition, when every child is honored as an artist in the classroom, children’s self-confidence rises.

The more a child moves, the more he or she is learning. Movement is embedded in the Montessori philosophy, as students move throughout the classroom to retrieve and return lesson materials, and many works engage movement of some type.  Research has shown that even simply standing while learning/completing assignments improves executive function. It has been known for many years that movement/exercise is vital for emotional- and physical health, but it can also improve one’s verbal memory as well as overall learning.  It also increases attention and motivation, two necessities in the Montessori classroom. (University of North Carolina Learning Center, 1).  Children can practice balancing, self-control, working towards achieving goals, and problem-solving through their movement activities.  As all work in the Montessori classroom is, the movement lessons taught to children are purposeful.  Movement lessons can have a similar aim to the work of practical life: order, coordination, concentration, and independence.

Music and its role in the classroom influences children’s motor, language, social, cognitive, and academic abilities (Ho et al., 2003; Costa-Giomi, 2004; Forgeard et al., 2008; Standley, 2008; Jentschke and Koelsch, 2009; Southgate and Roscigno, 2009; Yazejian and Peisner-Feinberg, 2009; Strait et al., 2010) (Dumont, E. et. al, 2017, p. 1).  According to Elizabeth Dumont:

> (M)usic may expose the child to challenges and multi-sensory experiences which enhance learning abilities and encourage cognitive development.  In particular, music can also engage cognitive functions, such as planning, working memory, inhibition, and flexibility.  These functions are known as executive functions…..there is agreement on the complexity and the importance of (executive function) for learning and development (Gioia et al, 2000) (Dumont, 2017, p. 1).

As in all areas of the Montessori classroom, the art, music, and movement lessons proceed from the simplest/most concrete to increasingly challenging/abstract, helping students progress in increments.  One example of this is through art lessons beginning with a simple lesson including paper on a tray, a pencil/graphite stick, and an eraser.  Students are taught to make marks on the paper, with attention drawn to the lines that naturally occur in their art (and in nature).  The pencil work progresses to working with colored pencils, utilizing primary colors first, secondary colors are introduced later.  After working with colored pencils, crayon work can be introduced (utilizing primary colors first).  Adding texture is added during later lessons.  Children then progress to working with water-soluble markers, then permanent markers, then watercolor pencils, soft pastels, oil pastels, etc.  Children are introduced to various art mediums at one time, then allowed to explore that medium prior to progressing towards learning new techniques with that medium or adding a different medium to their art lesson repertoire.  The art, music, and movement curriculum scaffolds itself in a similar way to the curriculum in all other areas of the classroom, with lessons progressing in complexity and direct aims building upon one another as the child progresses through the various lessons.

Art, music, and movement lessons (as well as all lessons in the classroom) must always be inclusive/culturally responsive.  This means examining all lessons and materials presented through an anti-bias lens (which requires constant growth in the guide towards anti-biasedness as a whole).  However, in seeking to create an anti-bias classroom, great care must be taken in ensuring the guide avoids cultural appropriation regarding art, music, and movement lessons (such as avoiding having children create their own dreamcatchers, as those have significant spiritual meaning for Native Americans and would thus be a form of cultural appropriation).  The guide must always conduct research and, whenever possible, speak with people of the various cultures/religions represented by certain art, music, or movement practices to learn more about what is/isn’t appropriate to share with the children.  Growth in knowledge about other cultures (especially those most relevant to the children in the classroom) is a part of the process the guide must engage in, one that promotes his/her own spiritual growth.

Dr. Montessori wrote extensively about the spiritual preparation of the guide, who is the preparer of the environment for the children.  In addition to analyzing his/her growth toward being anti-bias and inclusive and growing in knowledge about the beliefs and practices of other cultures, another way in which the guide must be spiritually prepared occurs through meticulously observing the amazing children in his/her care.  The focused observations of the children inevitably lead to a greater respect for their amazing intelligence and arc towards peacefulness inherent in all children, provided the right environment.  This can inspire wonder in the guide, as well as an ever-growing passion towards aiding these young people who are literally the future and hope of mankind.  Due to the breadth and depth of the path before the guide, who is expected to be “perfect” and to nurture children’s growth in every way, it is important that guides also engage in self-care and nurture their own growth as well. The art, music, and movement curriculum can be of great help in nurturing the guide, so he/she can nurture the children in his/her care as well.

Pursuing a balance which incorporates the beauty of the arts, music, and movement in one’s life will lead to a healthier guide in the classroom.  In addition, the guide can put herself in the place of the child as he/she pursues these as well and be inspired to wonder, discover, and explore right alongside the children.  The art, music, and movement lessons are ever-expanding and can be added to/revised according to the needs of various classroom and the continual growth and exploration of the guide in this area.  In addition, many artists and musicians can be found within the families of the students represented, and their talents in these areas might contribute to the growth of the art, music, and movement curriculum in the classroom as well.

### 1. Tissue Paper Collage (with Metal Insets)

{{< img class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/art/image001.webp" alt="Tissue Paper Collage" >}}

**Preparation:**
* Fine motor work, such as stringing beads, the knobbed cylinders 
* The Metal Inset work

**Materials:**
* Metal Insets
* Metal Inset Tray
* Tissue Paper
* Wax paper (5 ½ by 5 ½)
* Glue and water mixture (to form a paste)
* Paintbrush 
* permanent marker

**Points of Consciousness:**\
The tissue paper needs to be stuck onto the sticky surface of the Contact paper
Light can pass through the tissue paper, allowing for a reflection of light (and of the colors of the tissue paper) onto other surfaces

**Direct Aims:** 
* To refine fine motor skills by tracing a metal inset work on Contact paper
* To cut with precision along the lines/curves traced on the Contact paper
* To refine developing fine motor skills by either tearing or cutting pieces of tissue paper
* To create a design with tissue paper 

**Vocabulary:**\
Reflection (light reflection): This occurs when rays of light encounter a surface or boundary that doesn’t absorb the energy of the radiation and bounces the light waves away from the surface
Translucent: This is when light is allowed to pass through (as with the tissue paper)
Primary colors: red, yellow, and blue

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Show the child where the work is kept 
3. Place a piece of wax paper on the metal inset tray
4. Place three different-colored pieces of tissue paper on the tray (possibly choose to begin with the primary colors: red, yellow, and blue).  Bring the tray to a table.
5. Place the metal inset frame on top of the wax paper.  Demonstrate how to hold the metal inset frame with your left hand while tracing with your right (or reverse this for those who are left-handed). 
6. Begin tracing at the top and trace around the frame in a clockwise direction
7. Remove the frame and compare what has been traced to the inset
8. Either tear or cut the tissue paper squares into smaller pieces
9. Dip the paintbrush in the bowl with the mixture of glue and water
10. Spread the glue paste onto the wax paper
11. Place the tissue paper pieces on the wax paper metal inset, overlapping at times.  
12. Continue spreading the glue paste over the pieces of tissue paper that are placed.
13. Continue adding layers of tissue paper/glue paste, etc.  until the surface is covered.
14. Allow the creation to dry completely (1 full day)
15. Peel the tissue paper creation off the wax paper
16. Invite the child to hang their tissue paper collage in a sunny area (with double sided tape or by using a hole-punch and string tied to a hole at the top of the creation)

**Variations:**
* After working with primary colors of tissue paper, explore working with secondary, and later tertiary colors
* Use Contact paper as opposed to wax paper, and this eliminates the need for gluing
* Allow the child to create their own shapes with which to make tissue paper collages with

**Extensions:**
* Create collages with the tissue paper contact paper designs made by the entire class, or a “blanket” of tissue paper collages
* Explore a prism and how the light reflects through it in a similar fashion to the way light reflects through the tissue paper design
* Compare how the light shines through the colored tissue paper to the way light shines through colored glass-explore appropriate stained-glass art

**Artists of the Medium to Draw Attention To:**

Compare stained glass art and the way the light reflects through the glass to the colored tissue paper designs, show the children stained glass art.

(Leonid Afremov oil painting, She Left, https://afremov.com/images/product/image_1900.jpeg)

**Preparation:**
* Pencil and graphite work, colored pencil work, crayon work
* Water color work, tempera paint work, acrylic paint work

**Materials:**
* Oil Painting Canvas
* Oil Paint Brushes
* Palette knife (for utilizing large amounts of oil paints)
* Oil Paints (Marie’s Water Mixable Oil Colors are nontoxic and washable with water) (https://www.jerrysartarama.com/marie-s-water-soluble-oil-colors-18-set-12ml?gclid=CjwKCAjwi6WSBhA-EiwA6Niok4cIzW2RPlmmtZflchWIS0-iuAHfWb39NU-PjxSlYCw9IVr_N5Uh4hoCaNsQAvD_BwE)
* Linseed or safflower oil (non-toxic oil that can be used to clean brushes or surfaces in the event that they don’t clean well with only soap and water)
* Tabletop easel

**Points of Consciousness:**
* (Be sure to do your research regarding what oil paints/oils you choose, as many can be toxic…please see the recommendations above).
* Oil painting can take time….it is a work that doesn’t have to be finished in a day, but can be gradually modified/worked on throughout time.  
* Consider having a large canvas that the entire class can contribute to over time
* Varying the ratio of oil to paint used impacts the thickness/thinness of the paint (show examples of oil paints with varying thickness: for instance, Claude Monet’s Monet’s Garden at Giverney, by Claude Monet and/or Melody of the Night by Leonid Afremov )

**Vocabulary:**
* Paint brush
* Canvas
* Palette
* Oil
* Thickness versus thinness
* Blending

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the child by saying, “I’d like to show you new painting materials.”  
2. Either on a tray or at an easel, place an oil painting canvas, a dish of the non-toxic oil, and a palette with an assortment of oil colors 
3. Place the canvas in front of the child (or have the child stand or sit in front of an easel), place the oil color palette and brush(es) to the side on which the child is dominant
4. “We can make this white canvas vibrant with colors by painting it with these oil paintings.”
5. Demonstrate making various lines/shapes/colors on your own canvas with the oil paintings
6. “We can dip our brush in this oil to help think this paint, to help it spread and blend…or, we can use only small amounts of oil, or no oil, and then our canvas will have thick splotches of the oil colors.” (Demonstrate these two ways of painting with oil paint and oil)
7. Invite the child to try these techniques on his/her/their own canvas
8. State, “Here’s a way I can explore making different types of lines with my oil painting” and paint thin lines, thick lines, curved lines, straight lines, etc. with the oil paint….
9. Invite the child to explore creating lines with their oil paints
10. Leave the child to explore this medium, checking back periodically.  (Document this exploration/work with photography, if the child permits, to place in their art portfolio).  

**Variations:** 
* Once the child has explored making thinner/thicker lines/shapes, explore mixing colors for shading (adding beige/white to lighten a color or brown/black to darken a color)
* Increasingly give the child more freedom with the materials as they have continued their lessons/work with the oil painting

**Extensions:**
* Allow for oil paintings to be saved for children to continue to return to throughout the week/throughout the month
* Consider having one large canvas the entire class is allowed to contribute to
* Have books with pictures of oil paintings available with information about the painter on the back

**Artists of this Medium to Draw Attention To:**
* Claude Monet
* Leonid Afremov
* Magdelena Carmen Frida Kahlo (often known as Frida Kahlo) (1907-1954)
* Georgia O’Keefe (1887-1946)
* Sofonisba Anguissola
* Laura Wheeler Waring (born in Connecticut in 1887-1948): among the artists displayed in the U.S.’s African American Art in 1927
* Alma W. Thomas 
* Gweondolyn Knight (painter and sculptor from Barbados, moved to New York in the 1930s)
* Faith Ringgold (American painter, Civil Rights activist and author): some of her art depicts violence, though….
* Emma Amos (some art depicts nudity, though)
* Wangechi Mutu (works in painting, sculpture, performance, and film….has paintings/collages that represent cultural trauma, self-image, gender constructs, and environmental destruction)

* To replicate objects in the classroom with clay

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the child to a new work with clay: “I know you’ve been working with the clay for some time now, and have even begun creating pinch pots. Today I’d like to invite you to another lesson with clay
2. Don an art apron
3. Bring the clay tray to a table (consider covering the table with a tablecloth or with paper bags).
4. Retrieve the bead stair
5. Demonstrate how to use your hands to create little spheres (about the same size as the beads) with your hands
6. After creating one bead, place this on the top of a bead triangle drawn on wax paper
7. Continue creating clay beads, until the bead triangle on wax paper has been filled with the correct number (55 in all)
8. Place the clay beads in a drying area and explain that we will return to the beads once they are dry
9. (After the clay beads are completely dry): Invite the child to check on their beads
10. Bring the beads to a table
11. Retrieve the acrylic or tempera paints
12. Grab the bead stair
13. Set the beads up in a bead stair on the wax paper
14. Proceed to paint the beads their corresponding colors

16. Show the child how to put art wire through the beads with more than one (starting with the two beads that need to be connected, then the three, then four, etc.)  
17. Restore the work to the shelf

**Subsequent Presentations/Variations:** One could also show how to make land and water forms by pressing the clay into the land and water form to make impressions, then taking the clay and water form away, thus creating one’s own impression of the land and water forms, or create models of the geometric cabinet….utilize laminated geography maps and create models of the maps using clay, etc.  

**Extensions:** Bring clay outside and make representations of natural items, like stones, seashells, sticks, etc.

{{< figure class="" src="/img/art/image025.webp" alt="Sculptures" caption="Beate Kuhn">}}

Beate Kuhn was born in Dusseldorf in 1927 and raised in an artistic family.  Her parents were a sculptor and a pianist.  She studied art history at the University of Freiburg for two years, then switched to clay.  From 1949-1951, she began working with a potter’s wheel.  She studied ceramics from 1951 to 1953, then later studied glazes.  In 1952, she began designing ceramics for Rosenthal, a renowned porcelain manufacturer.  Her brother designed a studio for her at her home and she worked there on her pieces.  At first her ceramics were functional, although with abstractly decorated surfaces.  By the 1960s, her pieces became more about sculptural art versus function and enjoyed working with positive and negative space with her pieces.

{{< figure class="" src="/img/art/image026.webp" alt="Sculptures" caption="Sargent Claude Johnson Chester">}}

Sargent Claude Johnson (October 1888-October 1967) had a Swedish father and mother of African-American and Cherokee ancestry.  His father died in 1897 and his mother died of tuberculosis in 1902.  He and his siblings went to live with his aunt, May Howard Jackson, and uncle.  May was a pioneer African American sculptor specializing in busts with themes of the African American people.  The boys of the family were sent to an orphanage in Massachusetts and the girls attended a Catholic school for African American and Native American girls.  Some of Sargent’s siblings chose not to identify as African American as adults, but identified as Native Americans or Caucasians.  He attended the California School of Fine Arts from 1919 to 1923.  He began showing his work with the Harmon Foundation of New York in 1926.  This foundation was known for its support of African-American art.  His art was often not included in “American art” because of how often his pieces ignored traditional western techniques and was inspired by foreign cultures, such as Mexican muralists Diego Rivera, Jose’ Clemente Orozco, and others.  His early work focused on racial identity.  From 1945 to 1965, Sargent made many trips to Oaxaca and Southern Mexico and began incorporating the people and culture into his art (https://americanart.si.edu/artist/sargent-johnson-2484)

Lei Xue was born in 1974 in Quindao, China.  He moved to Kassel, Germany and attended the Kassel School of Art and Design.  He studied oil painting before moving to Germany.  His pieces explore cultural identify and the impact of globalization.  He uses blue, which in Eastern culture means “sacrality” and “authenticity.”  He hopes to represent life and rebirth.  In this second piece, the melting porcelain becomes a metaphor for the melting of glaciers/global climate change.

She incorporates poetry, ceramics, ambient sound, and video, creating a sensorial experience.  Her pieces act to demonstrate the interplay between the contexts of land, ownership, immigration, and border. https://www.thecolornetwork.org/new-blog.  Her work has been shown in Iran and in the U.S.  Her work ‘Imagined Boundaries’, a multimedia digital installation on border issues, consisted of two exhibitions, one in Iran and one in the U.S, connecting visitors from both countries for a few hours at a time.  She writes: “My goal is to create work which speaks to universal human issues.  Today’s issues of immigration, borders and cross-cultural communication are interwoven with notions of identity, belonging and inhabitation.  I intend for my work to raise questions and promote engagement.  I want my art to be an intermediary language shared between individuals, nations, and cultures that speaks humanity” (https://www.thecolornetwork.org/new-blog).

5. [Crawling on the Classroom Ellipse/Alligator Crawl](#5-crawling-on-the-ellipseprogressing-to-an-alligator-crawl-on-the-line)



### 1. Walking/Balancing on Gonge River Stones

{{< figure class="float-right" src="/img/art/image031.webp" alt="Riverstones" caption="https://www.fatbraintoys.com/toy_companies/educators_resource/gonge_riverstones.cfm" >}}

**Preparation:** Walking on the line exercises, playing barefoot outside

**Materials:** Gonge Riverstones, Special container for the Gonge riverstones musical selections to play that aid in concentration

**Points of Consciousness:** Curling one’s foot will help one balance on the stepping stones; This is similar to the balance required when walking the line, only it requires even more balance and helps strengthen one’s core and one’s foot muscles

**Vocabulary:** Gonge riverstones, core

**Presentation:** 
1. Invite the children to the lesson
2. Bring out a special container with the riverstones hidden inside
3. “We have been given a gift in this box, boys and girls.  What do you think it might be?”  After listening to a few suggestions, state, “I’m ready to see what gift we have in the box.”  
4. Take out just ONE of the river rocks…..state, “Hmmm….I wonder what this could be.”  
5. Gradually remove more and more of the river rocks from the basket, until there are somewhere between 5 and 7 set up in a way that would make it possible for the children to step from one to another
6. “I know we’ve been practicing and perfecting walking on the line, which helps us prepare to balance.  Today, we get to try balancing  on these as we walk from one to another.”  
7. Demonstrate balancing on the Gonge river rocks, making movements that demonstrate it being tricky to balance as you move from one to the other.  Consider purposely floundering in your balance a bit.  
8. When you reach the last river stone, step down and give a quick bow.  
9. Invite the children to try.

**Variations:** Once children become confident with stepping from one river rock to another, start spreading them out a little further or arranging them differently so they might present a bit more of a challenge. In addition, once 

**Extensions:**
* Discuss how moving from river rocks to another strengthens your balance, and how this is a very important skill.  Also discuss the “core” muscles in your abdomen that are getting developed through this balance game.

**Points of Interest:**
* The river rocks
* Practicing balancing
* How one’s feet automatically curl up a bit as they place a food on a River rock.

**Control of Error:** the guide and the Gonge river rocks

**Direct Aim:** 
* Developing core muscles as while practicing balancing
* Curling one’s foot over the Gonge river rocks while balancing

**Indirect Aim:** Refining and perfecting movements

**ABAR Standards:** Identity 1: ID.K-2.1: I know and like who I am and can talk about my family and myself and name some of my group identities; Diversity 6: DI.K-2.6: I like being around people who are like me and different from me, and I can be friendly to everyone

### 2. Tracing “Lazy”/”Sideways” Eights/”Elephant Trunk” Lazy Eights

{{< figure class="float-right" src="/img/art/image032.webp" alt="Figure Eights" caption="(Image courtesy of: wholebrainliving.com)" >}}

**Preparation:** Grace and courtesy lessons, walking the line\
Sandpaper letters/numerals

**Materials:**
* “Lazy” Eights drawn or printed on large tagboard, possibly painted with sandy glue mixture (to make a large sandpaper sideways eight)
* CD player or computer to play music

**Points of Consciousness:**
* Be sure the lazy eights drawn on the tagboard are large enough that children will cross their midline while tracing them with their thumb.  Ensure they have sufficient practice with this material prior to having them make lazy eights with their whole arm.  

**Vocabulary:** Lazy/Sideways Eights

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Present a large tagboard with a sideways 8 painted/printed on it
3. Demonstrate how to trace the sideways 8 with two fingers (similar to working with the sandpaper letters/numerals)
4. (After the child has worked towards perfection of the sideways eight movement while tracing on the tagboard) invite the child to try making larger sideways eights with their whole arm: “Now, let’s try this a different way.  Let’s stand and pretend we’re elephants.  This arm will be our elephant trunk.”  (Choose the child’s dominant hand as their elephant trunk)
5. “We’re going to make our pretend elephant trunks make sideways eights, like this” (demonstrate for the child:  this motion should involve your head, eyes, and arm, if you have your arm up by your nose as if it is an elephant trunk)

**Variations:**
* Consider having children finger paint (with two fingers) the lazy eight on tagboard first
* Consider having a very large sideways eight on tagboard somewhere in the classroom for children to use their arms to follow at a distance.

**Extensions:** Have children try tracking a lazy eight with their eyes, utilizing a flashlight you shine on the wall in a darkened room (move the light slowly enough that children can follow).  
Read a book about elephants and how they use their trunks.  
Consider explaining some of the benefits for making the sideways eights (it’s an exercise that helps one part of your body cross over the other side, which helps create connections in one’s brain, tracking a sideways eight with one’s eyes helps one’s eyes develop, which is important for reading)  

**Points of Interest:**
* The sandpaper sideways eight is like the work with the sandpaper letters/sandpaper numerals but involves a larger body movement as it crosses the child’s midline.
* The large body movement of making the sideways eight with one’s whole arm is engaging and involves more of the child’s body than when they traced the large sideways eight on tagboard
* Consider playing elephant sounds while having children move their arms like elephant trunks (elephant calls, etc. mixed into the musical selection)


**Control of Error:**
* At first, the control of error is the sideways eight printed on tagboard for the child to trace, especially if it has been painted with the sand/glue mixture

**Direct Aim:**
* To cross the midline
* To utilize both sides of one’s brain in coordinated movements

**Indirect Aim:** To prepare for reading and writing

**ABAR Standards:** Identity 1: ID.K-2.1: I know and like who I am and can talk about my family and myself and name some of my group identities; Diversity 6: DI.K-2.6: I like being around people who are like me and different from me, and I can be friendly to everyone

### 3. Log-Rolls

{{< figure class="float-right" src="/img/art/image033.webp" alt="Log-Rolls" caption="My Gym Children’s Fitness Center. Build Kid’s Core Strength with Log Rolls!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZE8tDHYBIQ, uploaded 15 June 2017.  Downloaded 30 April 2022." >}}

**Preparation:** Walking the Line activities, swinging (to develop one’s core)

**Materials:** a comfortable mat to roll on indoors or a grassy hill/grassy flat area outside

**Points of Consciousness:**
* Help the child lay flat on their back, encourage them to hold their arms and legs together to prevent them from utilizing their arms and legs to help them roll as opposed to their core muscles.

**Vocabulary:** log rolling, sideways/lateral eights, 

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Point out the large space to the child: “This is a lesson we need a lot of space for.”
3. Lay down on your back, with hands straight out above your head (and holding your hands together), possibly consider wrapping your legs around one another as well
4. State, “Now, I’m going to try to roll my body like this.”  (Roll your body)
5. State, “You can try now.”  

**Variations:** This activity can be done indoors our outside.  It might be easiest to introduce children to rolling down a small hill outside first, prior to introducing them to rolling without a hill to help them.  

**Extensions:** Once children have become adept at log rolling, consider making a log-rolling path inside or outside

**Points of Interest:** This activity requires a fair amount of strength from one’s core muscles and is challenging to not utilize one’s arms/legs at first, but as children practice more and more, they will strengthen their core and become more adept in this movement.  Log-rolling can also help develop children’s vestibular system (used for balance, sense of movement, and bilateral coordination).  It also helps children develop muscle tone, especially in their core/trunk and bilateral coordination.  (https://www.lumierechild.com/lumiere-childrens-therapy/at-home-occupational-therapy-activities-for-children-with-sensory-processing-issues).

**Control of Error:** The guide is the control of error at first, but once the child has been able to successfully complete the log rolls, he/she can serve as his/her own control of error.  The control of error consists in being able to successfully roll while not utilizing one’s arms/legs.  

**Direct Aim:** To roll with utilizing just the core muscles (not one’s arms and legs); to complete 3-4 rolling rotations at a time

**Indirect Aim:** To develop the vestibular system, to strengthen one’s core, to increase one’s ability to balance

**ABAR Standards:** Identity 1: ID.K-2.1: I know and like who I am and can talk about my family and myself and name some of my group identities; Diversity 6: DI.K-2.6: I like being around people who are like me and different from me, and I can be friendly to everyone

{{< spacer >}}


### 4. Mirror Me Activity

**Preparation:** Lessons with the guide (because the child has already practiced repeating the guide’s actions/movements with increasing perfection)

**Materials:**  Optional: handheld mirrors for each child, such as the Tasalon Hand Mirrors found at Amazon, otherwise another large classroom mirror could be an optional material as well

**Points of Consciousness:** First, allow the child to watch his/her own reflection in the mirror as he/she moves, then allow him/her to emulate a reflection alongside another child. As the children in the class become more familiar with this lesson, you can invite more than two to the lesson at a time.

**Vocabulary:** Reflection, mirror neurons (optional)

**Presentation:** 
1. Invite at least two children to a lesson
2. Invite both children to either utilize a large handheld mirror or a large mirror on the wall in the classroom as they move their bodies.  (Consider providing them with some movement directions if they seem to struggle with ideas).
3. State, “When you see yourself in the mirror, that’s called your reflection.  It’s a reflection of yourself.  Now, you get to work with a partner and take turns being like a reflection for them.”  
4. Consider being the first to partner with a child and offer to be the mirror first (for the children to see what you do). Then, have the children be partners with one another.  
5. State, “One person gets to be the mirror/reflection first, the other child gets to lead the movements.”  (You might have to help children decide who gets what roll first).  Ensure the children that, “Both partners will have a chance to be the mirror and the lead.”  
6. After one child has been the mirror, state, “Let’s switch.  The other partner gets to be the mirror.  Remember, try to follow exactly how your partner moves.”

**Variations:** This can be worked on in groups or as a partner activity.

**Points of Interest:** Children will be interested in the accuracy in which they can copy a partner’s movements.  Certain movements might inspire laughter/giggles.

**Control of Error:** The children will be the control of error for one another, seeing whether the mirror truly emulates the actions of the child who is the leader.

**Direct Aim:** To mirror the images of another, activating one’s visual system as well as one’s mirror neurons, which help children empathize and learn from others.  In addition, they support observational learning.

**Indirect Aim:** Developing self-awareness, concentration, and coordination

**ABAR Standards:** Identity 1: ID.K-2.1: I know and like who I am and can talk about my family and myself and name some of my group identities; Diversity 6: DI.K-2.6: I like being around people who are like me and different from me, and I can be friendly to everyone

### 5. Crawling on the Ellipse/Progressing to an “Alligator” Crawl on the Line

**Preparation:** Walking on the line, grace and courtesy lessons

**Materials:** a classroom ellipse

**Points of Consciousness:** Help ensure students are crawling bilaterally, with the leg and arm of opposite sides of the body moving forward at the same time

**Vocabulary:** Ellipse, “Alligator” crawl, music for a “cat” and music for an “alligator” (or images for these)

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the child(ren) to the lesson
2. “We’re going to move like a cat on this rug today.  A cat holds their head up like this, and we’re going to use our arms and legs like this” (demonstrate being on your hands and knees, ready to crawl forward.  When you do crawl forward, point your toes).  “Whenever you hear this music (play sample), please move like a cat.”  “When the music stops, please freeze.”
3. Repeat step two a few times, until children have demonstrated staring to crawl when they hear the music, and stopping when the music stops.
4. State, “Now, we’re going to practice crawling like an alligator.  That means we have to lay on our stomachs like this, and move our arms and legs like this” (demonstrate).  “When you hear this music (play sample), then move like this.”  
5. Repeat step 4 a few times until children demonstrate they can do the alligator crawl (by lying on their stomachs and using their arms/legs to pull themselves forward).  
6. State, “Now, you’re going to listen for the music that tells you how to move.  See if you can remember when to move like a cat or move like an alligator on the line.”  
7. Play the game for a few minutes, switching when you play the “alligator” music and the “cat” music (or alternatively, when you hold up a cat picture or an alligator picture).  
8. State, “When we move our bodies like that, we’re not just exercising our bodies.  We’re exercising our brains!” 

**Variations:** Gradually introduce different moves for different animals and music to represent them, such as jumping like a kangaroo, waddling like a penguin, soaring like a bird, etc.  

**Extensions:** Read literature about the animals you incorporate in the movement game; consider watching a sample of the animal moving in a similar way as to how you are trying to demonstrate to the children

**Points of Interest:**
* Animals move in different ways and we can imitate some of their movements
* Various music can inspire you to move in different ways

**Control of Error:** The guide, the child’s ideas/ways of moving like an animal

**Direct Aim:** Crawling upright and on stomachs around the ellipse
Associating different music with different ways of moving along the ellipse (exercising our working memory as well as our bodies)

**Indirect Aim:** Crossing the midline, Exploring movement and music (and their connection)

**ABAR Standards:** Identity 1: ID.K-2.1: I know and like who I am and can talk about my family and myself and name some of my group identities; Diversity 6: DI.K-2.6: I like being around people who are like me and different from me, and I can be friendly to everyone

### 1. Introduction to the Orchestra: Welcome to the Symphony Lesson AND Introduction to Landfill Harmonic and The Recycled Orchestra

{{< grid-table class="col-2" >}}

{{< img class="preview-lg pure-img" src="/img/art/image034.webp" alt="Welcome to the Symphony Book Cover" >}}

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/art/image035.webp" alt="Landfill Harmonic Children">}}

{{< /grid-table >}}


**Preparation:** Grace and courtesy lessons, the silence game/listening activities, work with the Montessori globe

**Materials:**
* Welcome to the Symphony by Carolyn Sloan
* Pictures of various orchestras
* Laptop computer with links to music
* Images of Landfill Harmonic and The Recycled Orchestra
* Video clips of Landfill Harmonic and The Recycled Orchestra

**Points of Consciousness:**
* Introduce the orchestra to students with a sound clip first, then introduce with the book/identifying instruments of the orchestra games
* Gradually introduce Landfill Harmonic/The Recycled Orchestra, after students have had lessons about the orchestra and begun to identify various sections of the orchestra

**Vocabulary:**
* Orchestra: a group of instrumentalists, especially one combining brass, string, percussion, and woodwinds
* Brass: a wind instrument made of brass: trumpets, trombones, French horns, and tubas.
* Strings: The largest section of the orchestra, includes the violin, viola, cello, bass, and harp.  The piano is also a combination of a string instrument and a percussion instrument.  
* Percussion: This family of instruments includes the timpani, xylophone, cymbals, triangle, snare drum, bass drum, tambourine, maracas, gongs, chimes, celesta, and piano (which is also a string instrument)
* Woodwinds: These instruments all used to be made out of wood, but now are made of wood, metal, plastic, and some combinations.  You play them by blowing air through a mouthpiece and opening or closing holes with your fingers to change the pitch.  Some woodwinds, such as the clarinet, oboe, and bassoon, use a thin piece of wood called a reed which vibrates when you blow across it.  Smaller woodwinds play higher pitches while the longer and larger instruments play lower notes.  The instruments in this section are the piccolo, flute, oboe, English horn, clarinet, and bassoon.  
* Dynamics: This is the variation in loudness or softness between notes or sections of music.  Music can be considered forte, or loud: mezzo-forte, which is medium loud, mezzo-piano, which is medium-soft, or piano, which is soft.  Music can also be fortissimo, which is very loud, or pianissimo, which is very soft/quiet.  
* Composer: The composer is the person who wrote the music.  
* Conductor: The conductor is the person who directs the performance of an orchestra or choir.  He or she can show the musicians when to start or stop, what pace to go, how loudly or softly to play, how abruptly or smoothly to play, etc.  

**Presentation:**
1. Invite a small group of children to a lesson at the rug (expect more to join you as their interest is piqued)
2. Begin with the silent game, inviting everyone to be quiet prior to the lesson being introduced
3. Select an orchestra piece to be played on the laptop for the children to listen to, such as Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, “Choral” by by Ludwig Van Beethoven (found at https://www.allclassical.org/10-iconic-pieces-of-classical-music/)  or John Williams’ Theme from Jurassic Park played by Vienna Philharmonic: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NqaupGcCpw)  (Consider eventually letting the children view the clips of the orchestra)
4. “You just listened to an orchestra.  An orchestra is a group of instrumentalists all playing the same song together. Did you hear different parts in the song?  An orchestra consists of different groups of instruments, such as the brass, the strings, the percussion, and the woodwinds.  I will show you a picture of each of these families of instruments.”  
5. Now that you’ve listened to an orchestra, I’d like to read a book about the orchestra to you.  Introduce the book Welcome to the Symphony by Carolyn Sloan.  Read the book.
6. Introduce the pictures for the various sections of the orchestra.  Introduce the sections of the orchestra with their pictures following the definitions listed above.
7. Play a game with the orchestra sections: pass a picture of an orchestra family to every child….have children sit in groups based on what picture they have.  Explain: “I’m going to play various parts of orchestra music showing different parts of the orchestra.  When your section of the orchestra is playing, hold up your picture.  There might be times you hear more than one section play at a time, and then you can all hold up your picture.  We want to listen for the different sections of the orchestra, the brass, the percussion, the strings, the woodwinds.  
8. Play the video introducing section of the orchestra found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr-l2m8twX0.  The woodwinds section is introduced at about 1:48 into the video; then the video breaks the woodwinds into sections based on which woodwind is played; the brass section is introduced at 5:45 in the video, again, introducing one instrument from the brass family at a time, then percussion instruments are introduced at about 8:25 in the video, then the strings section at about 9:34 in the video, 
9. Pass out pictures of different sections of the orchestra.  Be sure every child is given a picture.  Pass them out in random order.  Invite the children to “find other students in your section.” 
10. Have the children sit in groups according to their section of music.
11. Now, we’re going to play this orchestra music again, and when you hear your instrument section, or instrument family playing, you get to stand up and dance to the music with your picture.  It can be tricky at first, but I can help you.
12. Play the orchestra family game, having children of various sections standing up and dancing when their section is played.  As you play this game at additional times, try to vary what orchestra family students are in, thereby allowing students to have different sections of the orchestra they are identifying with.
13. After children have had fun exploring the different orchestra families with the above game, explain that music is played all over the world, but that in many areas, orchestra instruments are very expensive and many families cannot afford them.  Introduce children to the Landfill Harmonic Orchestra video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYbORpgSmjg
14. Discuss with the children their reactions to the students creating instruments out of garbage from the landfill they live nearby.

**Variations:**  This is a long lesson, consider breaking it into various days of a week, exploring one section of the orchestra a day, then gradually building up into playing the game.  Introduce various The Story Orchestra books over time to the students.  Consider introducing various composers with these stories.

**Extensions:** Continue to play the game with identifying families of instruments in the orchestra, but gradually increase the difficulty with various pieces of music with two or more sections playing at the same time.  (Wait until children can confidently identify the sections of instruments in the first video).  Consider inviting members of the community into the classroom who play various instruments from the orchestra. 
Invite children to attend local orchestra events near you, such as The Minnesota Orchestra or Concerts in the Park in Hudson, WI.  Ask if your class can take a field trip to a local high school to listen to them rehearse for a band concert or consider inviting members from their band to visit your classroom to play instruments.  

**Play Instrument Lotto:** (Make Lotto boards with pictures of instruments by section, then stones to place on the pictures once a child hears that instrument played) 

**Points of Interest:**
An orchestra is when a group of instrumentalists work together to create beautiful music.  The various pieces of orchestral music themselves are points of interest.  Children all over the world can create their own instruments out of garbage found and create beautiful music, which adds beauty to their lives as well as others.  Music is powerful and beautiful!

### 2. Introduction to Classical Composers from and moving to their music along the line

{{< img class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/art/image036.webp" alt="Wolfgang Mozart Book">}}

Composers of European ancestry to explore: Wolfgang Mozart (1756-1791): composed over 800 pieces during his short lifetime, he was born in Salzburg.  While he and his sister Nanerll were young, their family toured Europe and Mozart and Nanerll would play music as child prodigies.  Mozart was either four or five when he created his first compositions.  

Website to listen to his music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqesejcElLA

Beethoven: 
Beethoven was born in Germany in 1770 and lived until 1827 and is a widely respected composer of classical music.  He lived a difficult childhood, as his father was his first teacher and was not kind to him.  He was sponsored to travel to Vienna, where Mozart resided at the time, but Mozart died shortly afterwards, and it isn’t clear whether the two ever met.  Beethoven was able to learn from the composer Joseph Haydn during that time, however.  He didn’t follow the social customs of his time and was seen as unconventional, untidy, and clumsy.  He explored new and creative ideas in his music, which caused separation from his classical teachers Haydn and Salieri.  From his early twenties, his hearing began to deteriorate, and he was eventually completely deaf.  Even despite becoming deaf, he was able to compose beautiful music.  It did cause extreme struggles for him to perform with the orchestra, as he often fell out of time, causing him to be ridiculed by the public.  Therefore, he began playing piano less with an orchestra and retreated to privately composing music.  His most respected works were composed during his last 15 difficult years, including his Ninth Symphony.  The final part of the ninth symphony, often referred to as “Ode to Joy” is a symbolic musical representation of universal brotherhood.   (Pettinger, Tejvan. “Biography of Beethoven”, Oxford, UK. www.biographyonline.net, 28th May 2008. Last updated 1 February 2020). Downloaded 10 April 2022.  (Samples of his compositions can be heard on this site as well).   

**Preparation:** Grace and courtesy lessons, the silent game, introduction to the musical scale with the bells

{{< /grid-table >}}


**Points of Consciousness:** 
* Practice the silent game prior to the introduction of music
* Listen to the music with eyes closed
* Compare and contrast Mozart and Beethoven

**Vocabulary:**
Classical Music: Music played with instruments only, with an emphasis on elegance and balance, with homophobic textures (the melody and accompaniment), but with some counterpoint (where two or more melodic lines are combined)
Symphony: A musical composition for the full orchestra, typically involving four movements
Dynamics: (forte:loud, mezzo-forte: medium loud, piano:soft, mezzo-piano: medium soft) 

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the children to the group time rug.  
2.  Play a piece of Mozart music, such as those found at: https://www.udiscovermusic.com/classical-features/best-mozart-works-10-essential-pieces/.

4. Read Mozart: The Wonder Child: A Puppet Play in Three Acts by Diane Stanley.  
5. Explain, “We’re going to listen to a piece of music by Mozart, and this time, we get to walk along the line to his music.  When the music starts to fade, you will slowly become still, like a statue. Let’s see how still we can make our bodies when the music is not playing.”  
6.   Play the Mozart music, then gradually turn the volume down and encourage all children to “become still.”  
7. Repeat step 6 several times, then invite the children to sit back down.
8. State, “Boys and girls, tell me the name of the composer for that music again.”  (Mozart)
9. Excuse the children from the group with a game of Willabee Wallabee
10. Repeat the presentation steps on another day, alternating with introducing Beethoven, the Beethoven music, and the Beethoven literature.
11. Invite the children to dance at the rug to the music.  Pass out dancing streamers for the children to dance with.  
(After exploring the above lesson, invite the children to the following game).
12. We’re going to play a game.  I’m going to play a musical piece by Beethoven or by Mozart…..try to guess whose piece this is.”  

**Variations:**
Vary this lesson, highlighting various other composers OR different music from Mozart and Beethoven

**Extensions:** Continue studying composers by continent, creating a musician folder with images of the composers with cardstock background that matches the continent they are from (with the globe)

**Points of Interest:**
1. Listening to different music/moving to the musical along the rug
2. Learning who Mozart and Beethoven are
3. Dancing with dancing streamers to the various pieces of Mozart and Beethoven music
4. Identifying Mozart versus Beethoven music

**Control of Error:**\
The guide

**Direct Aim:** To learn about Mozart and Beethoven and identify some pieces of their music

**Indirect Aim:** To appreciate classical music; to dance to classical music

Music/Musicians to Explore: Mozart, Beethoven, and all of the artists listed below

**Extensions:** Exploring other classical musicians, especially of non-European/non-Western descent, as in the following lesson:

**ABAR Standards:** Identity 1: ID.K-2.1: I know and like who I am and can talk about my family and myself and name some of my group identities; Diversity 6: DI.K-2.6: I like being around people who are like me and different from me, and I can be friendly to everyone

### 3. Music: Exploring Various Artists from the Indigenous and POC Communities

**Preparation:** Listening to the sound of a bell/quieting at the sound of the three-tone bell

**Materials:** Pictures of musicians with the information about them written on the back, a map of the USA, a laptop to play music from, dancing scarves, rhythm sticks

**Points of Consciousness:** Students need to have lessons tapping to the rhythm with their hands first prior to introducing the rhythm sticks.  When the rhythm sticks are first introduced, have children practice first picking them up on cue and then placing them on the floor in front of them on cue prior to getting to play with them.  Gradually introduce students to tapping a rhythm with the rhythm sticks.  When students are given the scarves to dance with, define the space in which they can move with their bodies prior to giving them the scarves.

**Indigenous Musicians to Explore:**\
Kelly Jackson: From Wisconsin, she labels herself a Native Americana artist, combining Native American folk song, traditional Americana, reggae, and spoken word poetry.  She has won the Native American Music Award for best Americana Album of the Year (Spirit of a Woman) and toured around the country and to other countries.  She is a tribal activist, philanthropist, a mom and a grandmother.  She is cofounder of Spirit of a Woman, an organization offering personal and professional development opportunities for indigenous women.  (Song to explore: Wake Up)

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kPk4lMtZOg)



**Preparation:** Grace and Courtesy Lessons, Looking and listening at the sound of the bell

**Materials:**
* One of the classroom globes, image shown above, pictures of families from all over the world playing and working outside to be shown while the song is playing for the first time
* Book: Families by Sheila M. Kelly and Shelly Rotner

**Points of Consciousness:** Note that the Montessori globe and satellite picture of Earth look quite different, discuss how one is an image from a satellite sent to space, while the globe is a representation made to represent the Earth.  Discuss how the blue part visible is water: oceans such as Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Antarctic and how the vast majority of Earth is made of water (71%).   (Sing the song, “Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Antarctic” and point these out on the classroom globe).

**Vocabulary:** The names of the Oceans: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Antarctic, orbit (demonstrate how the earth orbits around the sun) satellite: something created by scientists that orbits the earth, just as the earth orbits the sun, which takes pictures to collect information

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the children to the lesson (this can be smaller groups of children at a time or the whole class)
2. Introduce the book Families by Sheila M. Kelly and Grace Rottner (if you created your own classroom book with pictures of classroom families, read that book first, then read Families by Sheila M. Kelly and Grace Rottner)
3. Read the book(s), discussing similarities and differences among families
4. Share the Montessori globe: discuss how all of the families of the world live on a planet called Earth, which the globe is created to represent.  Share how people who share a home are often a family, and every human being shares the same home: planet Earth, therefore, in some ways, all humankind is like a family, we all share one home.  
5. Show a satellite image of Earth, explaining this is a real picture of our planet taken from far away in space by a satellite, which is something created by scientists that circles the earth and takes images to help scientists gather important information
6. State, “I’m going to show you some pictures of different families while I play a song about our home, planet Earth.”  (Show the pictures from the book Material World: A Global Family Portrait by Peter Menzel, Charles C. Mann, and Paul Kennedy while playing: Jeremy Messersmith’s “Little Blue World” found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kPk4lMtZOg).
7. State, “It’s amazing, our planet Earth is home to all of life, plants, animals, and humans.  We all have one common home.”  (Possibly hold a discussion on how each child’s family takes care of their house/home).  
8. Invite the children to stand.  State, “Now, I’m going to pass each of you a blue and green dancing scarf, to represent the blue water and green land on Earth. When you hear the music, you can dance with these while listening to the song.  When the music stops, try to help your body find stillness again, like this (model standing still).”  
9. Model dancing with your scarves in a designated space while the song is playing.  Help students remember to maintain enough distance from others so as not to bump into others while dancing. 
10. Ring the bell and have students stop, look, and listen.  Invite students to lie down for a breathing exercise, with their scarves on their stomach.
11. Invite children to breathe, noticing whether their scarf rises and falls.  Encourage trying to breathe in such a way that the children can see the scarf rising and falling
12. After some calming breathing, invite the children to return the scarves to the designated container.  

**Variations:** This lesson can be repeated with different books, such as If the World were a Village: 2nd Edition, by David J. Smith and Shelagh Armstrong, 10 Things I can Do to Help My World by Melanie Walsh, If America Were a Village by David J. Smith, books about nature, etc.

**Extensions:** Choose something to do to help the world as a class: this could include cleaning up litter around the school, around one’s home, planting trees, volunteering to help someone in need, finding a body of water nearby and cleaning up litter around that area, etc.

**Points of Interest:** Comparing satellite images of Earth to the globe model in the classroom, discussing how 71% of the Earth is water, and how important water is for life on earth, as it nourishes all living things, noting that all the people of the world share one home: our planet Earth, learning about practical ways every person can help take care of Earth from the book listed above

**Control of Error:** The guide

**Direct Aim:**  To listen and dance to the song “Little Blue World” by Jeremy Messersmith, to discuss how the Earth is home to all living things, including all the families of the world

**Indirect Aim:** To appreciate the world in which all life exists, to grow in a desire to care for the Earth, which is the home of all life  

**ABAR Standards:** Identity 4: ID.K-2.4 I can feel good about myself without making other people feel bad, Diversity 8: DI.K-2.8 I want to how about other people and how our lives and experiences are the same and different, Diversity 10: DI.K-2.10: I find it interesting that groups of people believe different things and live their daily lives in different ways, Justice 14: JU.K-2.14: I know that life is easier for some people and harder for others and the reasons for that are not always fair

* The Montessori Globe
* A Child’s Book of Lullabies by Shona McKellar and illustrated by Mary Cassatt
* Lullabies Around the World by Mrs. Lisa Yannucci, edited by Mr. Jason Pomerantz, translated by Ms. Monique Palomares

**Points of Consciousness:**
* Many cultures around the world incorporate songs with the “sh” sound, which is naturally soothing for babies, as part of their lullabies
* Music is found in all cultures around the world, and all cultures around the world have lullabies, though every culture’s lullabies vary (https://www.wbur.org/news/2019/11/28/lullaby-harvard-music-universal).

**Vocabulary:** possibly lullaby, if children haven’t heard that term before

**Presentation:**
1. Invite a group of children (or the whole class) to the lesson
2. Begin singing, “All the Pretty Little Ponies” (or some other lullaby you think children are familiar with)
3. State, “Did you know that all of the families around the world sing lullabies to their children?  The lullabies are different in different families, just like the families in this classroom probably all sing their own lullabies.  Is there anyone who would like to share theirs?”
4. “We’ve heard some lovely classroom lullabies, now I’d like to share with you just a few more from around the world.”
5. Read one of the lullaby books listed above, such as Hush, Baby, Hush! By Kathy Henderson and Pam Smy
6. Play a few lullabies from around the world, highlighting where they are from by pointing the countries out on the globe: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1JPCVROsLh4E7zmzUGvuTDFikc_Lbsfl
7.  Encourage the children to rock or sway side to side as they listen to the music, explaining how this movement is soothing/calming for many infants and young children especially
8. Ask the children, “Did you notice anything similar in the lullabies?  Did you notice anything different in the lullabies?”

**Variations:**
* You can vary which lullabies you introduce to children…Change which lullaby books you share with children.

**Extensions:**
* Invite the children (and/or their families) to share their own family lullabies with the class, you could create a classroom book and CD of family lullabies.  Each family could be given a page in which to include an image of their family during their bedtime routine (or in pajamas, or reading books to one another) with their own lullaby written on each page.  This book can be read to the students and the lullabies can be taught.  
* Invite families in the community who are interested to share their lullabies/bedtime routine, etc.  
* Invite the class to think of their own classroom lullaby: what would they want to sing about?

**Points of Interest:**
* Lullabies are comforting and soothing, and seem to be part of human nature, as they are found in all cultures

**Control of Error:** The guide

**Direct Aim:** To listen to lullabies, to discover that all cultures around the world have lullabies in their own language, to rock one’s body from side to side

**Indirect Aim:** To learn about families of a variety of backgrounds having lullabies, To discuss how babies of all cultures are soothed by the rhythm of music and possibly even adding the side-to-side movement with it.  

**ABAR Standards:**  Identity 1: ID.K-2.1: I know who I am and can talk about my family and myself and name some of my group identities, Identity 2: ID.K-2.2: I can talk about interesting and healthy ways that some people who share my group identities live their lives, Identity 5: ID.K-2.5: I see that the way my family and I do things is both the same as and different from how other people do things, and I am interested in both, Diversity 7: DI.K-2.7: I can describe some ways that I am similar to and different from people who share my identities and those who have other identities, Diversity 8: DI.K-2.8 I want to know about other people and how our lives and experiences are the same and different, Diversity 10: DI.K-2.10: I find it interesting that groups of people believe different things and live their daily lives in different ways

### Music Lesson 6: What a Wonderful World by George David Weiss and Bob Thiele, illustrated by Ashley Bryan, sung by Louis Armstrong

{{< grid-table class="col-2" >}}

{{< img class="" src="/img/art/image044.webp" alt="What a Wonderful World Book" >}}

{{< img class="" src="/img/art/image045.webp" alt="Louis Armstrong Playing Trumpet">}}

{{< /grid-table >}}

**Preparation:**

**Materials:** 
* What a Wonderful World by George David Weiss and Bob Thiele, illustrated by Ashley Bryan
* Laptop with which to play video or clip of Louis Armstrong singing, “What a Wonderful World”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqhCQZaH4Vs
* Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-T6aaRV9HY
* Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddLd0QRf7Vg (videos of different children’s choirs/individuals singing the song)
* Images of families from the classroom and families from around the world,
* Images of nature from every continent

**Points of Consciousness:**  
* Beauty and wonder are found all over the world

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the children to the lesson (small group or whole group)
2. Introduce the book What a Wonderful World by George David Weiss and Bob Thiele, illustrated by Ashley Bryan
3. Take a “picture walk” through the pages, inviting children to talk about what they’re seeing on each page
4. Read/sing the book
5. State, “This song was sung by a very famous singer and trumpet player named Louis Armstrong.  Explain that Louis Armstrong was born in New Orleans (show on the map of the U.S.A.) in 1901. He had to stop school after fifth grade and work to help support his family.  He was arrested at the age of 11 for something he participated in during a New Year’s Eve celebration. Thankfully, children are no longer get arrested.  While he was in a home for boys, he learned how to play cornet.  He joined a band at the age of twenty.  He was married in 1924, at the age of 23.  When he was 24, he began making his own records.  He was a very influential jazz musician, traveling America and sometimes Europe as well.”
6. State, “I’m going to play a video of Louis Armstrong singing this song while I still show the pictures.”  (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqhCQZaH4Vs).
7. State, “Now I’m going to pass out dancing scarves to each of you, and we can dance while we listen to Louis Armstrong sing this song.  When the music stops, try quietly tip-toeing back to your seat.”  (Gradually fade the music until it is silent prior to having the children tip-toe to their seats).  
8. Discuss how: “Even though Louis Armstrong was in a home for boys, he was able to overcome difficulty to become the powerful influence on jazz music that he became.  And that home gave him great stability, so much so that when he visited that home again many years later, he curled up in his former bed for some moments of peace and quiet and fell asleep.   Many people today still face difficulties and challenges, especially people who are Black, Latino, Native American, or those who have had challenges in life that contributed to their spending time in jail/prison.  Many of those people rise up against those challenges to lead content, peaceful lives that contribute to the wellbeing of others.”

**Variations:** Introduce the children to others who have sung this song, such as children’s choirs around the world, other famous artists, etc.

**Extensions:** State, “We do live in a wonderful world, don’t we? Let’s make a list of some of our favorite things we see here in _____(name of the state you’re in).   Let’s see if we can write different lyrics for this song about what we see in _____.”  (Try singing the song with lyrics the children have provided). In addition, encourage children to make a page of what they see, with their own drawings, for a class book about our wonderful world.   Listen to “What a Wonderful World” sung by different artists/children’s choirs, etc.  Gradually teach the children to sing verses of the song.

**Points of Interest:** The world is a beautiful place, Louis Armstrong has dealt with adversity and overcome it, one day even being coined “Ambassador Satchmo” due to how often he traveled to other nations, sharing his  music.

**Control of Error:** The Guide
