## The Decimal System

>The decimal system is the foundation on which we rely
to sort numerical quantities.\
Its introduction into our world,\
which dates back to the Arabs in the Middle ages,\
is an aid to calculation so ingenious that it enables us,\
including children,\
to count large quantities.\
Calculation is nothing more than abbreviated counting.\
As in all work of simplification,\
the key lies in the greater degree of clarity achieved.\
Simplicity and clarity are the very qualities needed\
to bring facts within the reach of the child.\
Therefore, the first step should be to provide children\
with the construction of the decimal system itself\
rather than to count or calculate,\
because these two things are achieved\
with easy procedures\
offered by the decimal system.

### Introductory Tray

Learning the quantities and symbols for 1, 10, 100, 1000

**3 presentations:**\
I. quantities alone\
II. numeral cards alone\
III. combine quantity and numeral cards

> “The material that we provide to children, to understand the decimal system, is threefold and composed of objects, numerical symbols and words…The two materials – the decimal system beads and cards – lend themselves to easy, clear combinations, offering opportunities for a very large number of exercises and, therefore, ample practice. It explains why, once the interest is aroused, the decimal system presented in this form becomes a source of activity.” 
> Maria Montessori
Psychoarithmetic: Arithmetic developed under the guidelines outlined by child psychology, 1934/2016 (page 16)

**Materials:**\
Wooden rectangular tray, lined with black felt, which displays (left to right) a thousand cube, a hundred square, a ten bar, and one golden bead
Decimal numeral cards for 1,000, 100, 10, and 1 will be used in presentation II and III

**Note:** the tray is lined with black felt to help the beads stand out. For this reason, golden felt should not be used. Squares of green, blue, and red felt, which correspond to the colors on the decimal cards, should be in a separate basket on the shelf and used as a scaffolding visual cue for presentation III if needed. Placing the unit bead in a container, such as a gold bowl, could reduce the child’s opportunity to see the difference in size between the hierarchies.

**Prerequisites:**\
0-10 activities, knows symbols and quantities 0-10, sensorial activities to know “cube,” and grading exercises to understand small vs. large.

**Direct Aim:**
* sensorially experience the golden bead quantities and corresponding numeral cards
* practice identifying quantities one, ten, hundred, and thousand
* learn vocabulary of the numerals and quantities

**Indirect Aim:**
* preparation for understanding place value
* preparation for future work with golden bead material
* grow toward abstraction

**Age:** 4 – 5 years

**Presentations:**

{{< figure class="float-right" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image001.webp" alt="Golden Beads" caption="Quantity only; black emphasizes the difference in size" >}}

**Presentation I**\
Present the “objects” for understanding decimal system.

1.  Place the tray on a rug (near the center). Bring down the unit bead toward the bottom of the rug. "This is one bead." Give it to the child to hold for a moment, then have the child return it on the rug. Point to the bead and say, “This is one/ a unit.”

2.  Bring down the ten bead bar. "This is a ten bead bar." Give it to the child to hold for a moment, then have the child return it on the rug, just to the left of the unit bead. Point to the ten bar and say, “This is ten.”

{{< figure class="float-right" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image003.webp" alt="Golden Beads" caption="More than just a wooden tray. Avoid putting the unit bead in a container" >}}

3.  Bring down the hundred bead square. "This is one hundred bead square." Give it to the child to hold for a moment, then have the child return it to the rug, just to the left of the ten bar. Point to the hundred square and say, “This is one hundred.”

4.  Do the second period of a three-period lesson: "Show me the hundred bead square"; "Show me the ten bead bar"; "Show me one bead." Continue with the second period lesson but switch to emphasize quantity number:  “Show me one/a unit.”  “Show me ten.”  “Show me one hundred.”

5.  If the child is ready, continue with the introduction of the thousand cube, otherwise, resume this later. Bring down the thousand bead cube. "This is one thousand bead cube." Give it to the child to hold for a moment, then have the child place it on the rug, to the left of the hundred square. Point to the thousand cube and say, “This is one thousand.”

**Note:** Some Montessori teachers believe the 1,000 cube should never be presented the same day as the 100 square. Observe the child and use your good judgment. Perhaps the child has been keenly interested and observed many lessons with the golden bead material, for example, and is already aware of the term “cube” from sensorial lessons.

6.  Do a second period review with all four quantities. Complete third step of three period lesson, “What is this?” in subsequent lesson when appropriate.

**Presentation II**\
Present the “numerical symbols” for understanding the decimal system.

{{< figure class="float-right" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image005.webp" alt="Numerical Symbols" caption="Themontessorialbum.com" >}}

1.  Present the 1, 10, 100, and 1000 numeral cards via a three-period lesson. Place “1” card on rug and say “One.” Place the “10” card on the rug and say, “Ten.”  

2.  Begin with the 1 and 10 cards (already known by the child), then 100.  Say, “You know this says 1 and this says 10,” as you point to the cards.  Say, “This says one hundred,” as you point to the 100 card. “One.” (point) “Ten.” (point) “One hundred.” (point)

3.  Invite the child to feel the length of the wooden rectangle number cards as you present them.

4.  Review 1, 10, and 100 cards with a three-period lesson. Continue with the 1000 numeral card.

5.  Complete a second period review all four numerals.

6.  Perform a third period assessment in subsequent lessons when appropriate.

**Presentation III**\
Associate “objects” with “numerical symbols” and emphasize correct “words” by continuing to say:\
“This is one, this says one.”\
“This is ten, this says ten.”\
“This is one hundred, this says one hundred.”\
“This is one thousand, this says one thousand.”

{{< img class="float-right" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image007.webp" alt="Numerical Symbols" >}}

1.  Place the one/ a unit bead on the rug, say its name, and place the corresponding numeral card below it. Say, "This is the symbol for one (unit) bead." Point to the unit bead and say, “This is one.” Point to the numeral card and say, “This says one.”

2.  Place the ten bead bar to its left, say its name, and place the corresponding numeral card below it. Say, "This is the symbol for one ten bead bar.”  Point to the ten bar and say, “This is ten.”  Point to the numeral card and say, “This says ten.”

3.  Continue this procedure with the 100 and 1000.

4.  Perform a second period review of the quantities and the symbols.  

5.  Complete third period assessment, “What is this?” in subsequent lesson when appropriate.

**Points of Interest:**
* exploring the golden beads – texture, shape, weight, color
* seeing 10 beads on a bar
* seeing 10 bars make a square
* seeing 10 squares make a cube
* wooden numeral cards
* association of beads and cards

**Control of Error:**
* size relationships are similar for bead material and number cards
* sufficient repetition of lesson/games
* accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness

**Variations:**
* Child makes own numeral cards.
* Place the one bead over the ten bar, counting by the one bead up to ten….demonstrate that the one hundred is ten of the ten bars and count by ten, demonstrate that the thousand is ten of the hundred squares and count up to 1000 by 100 while demonstrating the golden beads.
* Incorporate a memory game. Child closes eyes and an item is removed and hidden under a scarf or behind back.  Child identifies missing item. Item is revealed and identified.

**Extensions:**
* Introducing 1000 may be seen as an extension.
* Identify bead quantity when blindfolded by feeling it.
* Play a sensorial game similar to the baric tablets game, “Same or different?” Child is blind-folded, hands are flat with palms up. One of the four bead quantities is placed in each hand. Child declares if hands are holding the same quantities or different quantities.  Child can also guess the quantity based on weight.
* Child strings beads on pipe cleaner to create ten bars, then attaches them to create a 100 square.

**Vocabulary:**
* one bead, ten bar, hundred square, thousand cube
* “This is ___.”  “This says____.”
* one, one ten, one hundred, one thousand

### Building Tray (Tray of Nines)

Showing the relationship between 1, 10, 100, 1000 – the “final play between nine and ten” as the move is made to the next order/hierarchy. 

> “The key to the decimal system lies in the final play between nine and ten. This is the key that opens the door to the organization of the various groups of units into a highly interesting systematic framework. Indeed, exceeding nine by only one, there are no digits to represent the new group that is formed: one has to go back to the beginning again, making use of the digit for one. The difficulty becomes apparent with the number 10, and from this point the need arises to resort to a structure. The number 10 is nothing but a return to counting again from one to nine. There is a sort of crossing of the Rubicon, forcing us to take a decisive leap to another order of units. And here, with only nine digits, the groups of units are organized into successive orders, without limits as to the number of times this can be repeated.  The first number in each order is number one, in ever increasing size or – and this is the same thing – of greater value.”

> Maria Montessori
Psychoarithmetic: Arithmetic developed under the guidelines outlined by child psychology (page 12)

There is a lesson that developed over the years called the Crisis of 9s. The lesson and the pictures are here BEFORE the Building Tray Lesson which we much prefer since it requires a great deal less time, uses the building tray (Tray of 9s), the cards for 999,  one card for 1000 and has a fun surprise – the “final play.”  This lesson Follows the Crisis of Nines lesson.

#### Crisis of Nines Lesson

**Materials:**
* Tray containing nine each of one beads, ten bars, and hundred squares AND a single thousand cube
* A box of small wooden decimal numbers
* Work rug large enough to accommodate final layout
* Work rug to hold supplies

**NOTE:** The “crisis of nine” extension additionally requires a unit bead, a ten bar, and a 100 square along with three corresponding containers.

{{< img class="float-right preview-md" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image009.webp" alt="One Bead on Mat" >}}

**Prerequisites:**\
Counting 1-10, experience with golden bead material names, number names & symbols, coordination, concentration

**Direct Aim:**\
Understand how numbers are built within each hierarchy – “The quantity gets larger as the count continues.”
Understand that a number’s place determines its value and that each hierarchy begins again with one. “Now, we start all over again – with one!”

{{< img class="float-right preview-md" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image011.webp" alt="One Bead and Symbol on Mat" >}}

**Indirect Aim:**
* preparation to be accurate when composing numbers and fetching quantities
* preparation for the decimal layout lesson

**Age:**  4 – 5 years

**Presentation:**

{{< figure class="float-right preview-md" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image013.webp" alt="Math on Mat" caption="Bring the one down. &#8220;One/ a unit.&#8221; Add another bead from gold source. &#8220;Two.&#8221;  &#8220;This is two.&#8221;" >}}

This presentation shows the child how numbers grow AND what happens when nine is reached in a hierarchy – “We start over again - with one!” This is an active counting lesson.

1.  Place one bead in upper right corner of rug. “This is one/ a unit.” Then, place the one numeral card to the left of the bead. “This says one.”

2.  Leave the one card where it is but pick up the bead and move it down, counting, “One.” Pick up another bead from the nearby bead source and say, “Two.”  “One. Two.”  “This is two.” Then, place the two numeral card to the left of the column of two beads. “This says two.”

{{< figure class="float-right preview-md" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image016.webp" alt="Math on Mat" caption="&#8220;This says two.&#8221;  Bring the two beads down, ONE AT A TIME, &#8220;One, two...&#8221; Add bead from gold source to make three. &#8220;This is three.&#8221; Then, place the three to left of beads. &#8220;This says three.&#8221;" >}}

3.  Leave the two card where it is.  Count the two’s beads into a spot just below them – this will start a row for the three’s beads. “One. Two.” Pick up another bead from the nearby bead source and say, “Three.”   “One. Two. Three.” (Point at each bead as you count.)  “This is three.” Then, place the three numeral card to the left of the column of three beads. “This says three.”

4.  Continue in the way until nine is completed. Look/point at the source for unit beads. “We are out of ones beads!”  “What comes after nine?” (Child should know, “Ten.”)  “We will need to start using the ten bars.”  Move the ten bar source within reach.

{{< grid-table class="col-2" >}}

{{< figure class="float- preview-md" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image022.webp" alt="Math on Mat" caption="One at a time, move the four’s beds down, “One, two three, four…" >}}

{{< figure class="float- preview-md" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image020.webp" alt="Math on Mat" caption="Then, add a bead from the gold source, &#8220;...five.&#8221;  &#8220;This is five.&#8221; Lay down the five card. &#8220;This says five.&#8221;" >}}

{{< figure class="float- preview-md" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image018.webp" alt="Math on Mat" caption="Continue with numbers through nine. &#8220;This is nine.&#8221;  &#8220;This says nine.&#8221;" >}}

{{< figure class="float- preview-md" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image024.webp" alt="Math on Mat" caption="&#8220;Oh no. We are out of ones.  If we had one more bead, we would have ten. We need to start using the tens!&#8221;" >}}

{{< /grid-table >}}

{{< figure class="float-right preview-md" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image026.webp" alt="Math on Mat" caption="&#8220;ONE ten.&#8221;  &#8220;This is one ten.&#8221;  Put the 10 card to the left. &#8220;This says ten.&#8221;" >}}


5.  Pick up one ten bar.  “Now we start all over again - with one!”  “We use one ten this time.” Place the ten bar to the left of the one card several inches. “This is one ten.”  Pick up the ten numeral card and place it to the left of the ten bar. “This says one ten.” 

6.  Leave the one ten card where it is but pick up the ten bar and move it down, counting, “One ten.” Pick up another ten bar from the nearby gold material source and say, “Two tens.”  “One ten. Two tens.” “This is two tens.” Then, place the two tens numeral card to the left of the column of two ten bars. “This says two tens.” (Do not say twenty, thirty, forty.)

{{< figure class="float-right preview-md" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image028.webp" alt="Math on Mat" caption="Continue with ten bars to &#8220;nine tens,&#8221; and then, when out of ten bars, &#8220;Now we will use the hundreds.&#8221; &#8220;This is 100.&#8221; &#8220;This says 100.&#8221; (Continue to nine hundreds then lay down a 1000 cube.)" >}}

7.  Continue in this way, showing how the quantity grows for tens and hundreds in the same way, and that when nine is reached in any single order, “Now we start all over again – with one!”

8.  When the 1000 is reached. Simply say, “We used all the ones, all the tens, all the hundreds, and the thousand cube!”  “Our tray is empty!” “We did it!”

9.  Invite the child to play a review game or put material away.

{{< figure class="preview-lg" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image030.webp" alt="Math on Mat" >}}


**Points of Interest:**
* seeing the progression build as the quantities move to represent the next numeral in the sequence
* running out of quantity and skipping to next column in hierarchy

**Control of Error:**
* exact quantity of golden beads needed for activity
* sufficient experience with the introduction tray lesson

**Variations:**\
3 period lesson 

Emphasize the “Crisis of Nine” with this variation. This variation includes the point of interest of “finding the ‘one more’” that will complete the required ten to move to the next decimal order/hierarchy. Here is how to add this element to the core lesson:

Before the lesson begins, put a unit bead in a special container and give it to another student across the room, “Can you take care of this for me? It is a very important unit bead.” The child you are presenting to should see this conversation take place. Repeat the same steps with a 10 bar and 100 square with two other children. 

When you reach the point in the lesson that the child has nine ones (or nine tens or nine hundreds) create great interest around retrieving the needed quantity to reach 10. Then, complete the exchange to secure the first quantity for the next hierarchy: exchange the ten unit beads for a ten bar from your decimal material supply. Then, when nine ten bars are counted, create excitement about retrieving the ten bar cared for by a child across the room. Place that ten bar with the nine existing ten bars, complete an exchange for a 100 square from the decimal material supply. This may be repeated for the move from the hundred hierarchy to the thousand cube.

**Extensions:**
* decimal layout
* exchange game with money

**Vocabulary:**
practice names of numerals and quantities

NOTE: The layout on the left is NOT the layout to use for this lesson. The intention of the Building Tray lesson is to show how a number grows by one as each numeral is added and as the count continues. The beads need to continue to accumulate. The child needs to see the quantity growing.

The layout on the left is used as a small “bank” for practice composing numbers. It is a “gold source.” See the “Little Bank” lesson.

#### Building Tray- Tray of Nines

**Materials:**\
Tray containing nine each of one/ unit beads, ten bead bars, and hundred bead squares AND then contents of the Decimal tray: a single thousand cube, a 100 square, 1 ten bar and a one/ unit. You can either bring the tray or the content to the rug but it must be hidden under a cloth and ideally out of sight or behind the teacher. Note that the UNIT bead needs to be placed in a  small special box/ container/ bag. 

**Prerequisites:**\
Counting 1-10, experience with golden bead material names, number names & symbols, coordination, concentration

**Direct Aim:**
* Understand how numbers are built within each hierarchy 
* Understand that each hierarchy can only have 9 of each category 

**Indirect Aim:**
* Preparation of exchanging 
* preparation to be accurate when composing numbers and fetching quantities
* preparation for the decimal layout lesson

**Age:**  4 – 5 years

**Presentation:**\
This lesson requires steps to set up in order that the surprise works smoothly.

1. Place the 1000 cube, the 100 square,  the 10 bar in a hidden place next to the teacher; get the special  container of the unit bead ready; bring the number cards to the rug but have them turned over, face down. Keep the 1000 card apart from the others and out of sight. 
2. Invite 2-3 children to the lesson. Take the special bag/container with the one/ unit bead but do not tell them what is inside. 
3. “We are going to need this later but I am going to ask X to hold on to it for me.” The teacher takes the one/ unit bead in the special container over to an older child who has had the lesson. 
4. Begin by naming the work –“ This is the Tray of nines… “ I think there must be nine of each. Let’s see.” 
5. Starting with the units, begin counting the units. Put them out in a column on the rug under the tray so the children can see and count nine unit beads.  “We have nine. Let’s put the card that says nine.”
6. Move deliberately to the tens area in the tray. Begin counting them saying one ten, two tens, three tens etc. and placing them next to each other to build a square on the rug under the tray so the children can see and count nine ten bead bars. “We have nine ten bead bars. Let’s put the card that says 9 tens or ninety.”
7. Repeat for the hundreds
8. Read the cards under the tray, “9  hundreds, 9 tens, 9 units This IS a Nine’s tray… “
9. “I wonder what is in the box I gave to X?” Would you like to go and ask X for the bag? But do not open it until you are here!” 
10. Once the child returns, invite them to open the bag/box. “ It is a one/ a unit! What shall we do with it? We should put it with the others. Now Let’s count how many units we have.” Count the units… when you arrive at ten, with great surprise pull out a hidden ten bead bar! Simply move the units away. (This is an exchange but they may not know that is yet) “Now, we have no units.” Turn the card over or remove it. 
11. Let’s see how many tens we have now. 1 ten, 2 tens, 3 tens, etc… when you arrive at 10 tens or a hundred, surreptitiously get the 100 square and say, here is a 100 square. 
12. Turn over the 90 card or remove it. “We have ZERO ones/units. ZERO tens… Lets see how many 100s we have now.”
13. Count the 100 squares… We you arrive at 1000, pull out the 1000 cube! Turn the card over or remove it. “We have ZERO ones/units. ZERO tens, 0 hundreds and 1 thousand. 
14. Get the 1000 card and place it under the 1000 cube or over the top of  turned cards. 
15. Recap the process with them: “We had a Nines Tray and we had 999. Then, we got one more unit – just one – and that made all the nines change.”\
“We had  nine ones units and then,  with one more one bead / unit, it became a ten, so now it is over here (point to  the area for the tens in the nines tray); then, we had nine tens and with then one more ten bar, it become a hundred square over here (point to  the area for the hundreds in the nines tray), then, we had nine hundreds with one more hundred, we now have a thousand cube… Pull out the thousand cube that is hiding.
16. Pull out the number card, 1000 and recap again, one thousand and zero in all the other places.  
17. Show great wonder at one bead changing 999 to 1000.

**Points of Interest:**
* it is a BIG work
* seeing the layout develop
* seeing the size of quantities increase
* feeling the increasing weight of the gold

**Control of Error:**
* the precise quantity of bead material needed
* accurate counting
* visual of stepped increase of quantity

**Variations:**\
The layout may be done in different ways:

### Decimal Layout (45 Layout)
Illustration of the concept of number for the numbers shown: 1-9, 10-90, 100-900, 1000-9000.

**3 presentations:**\
I. quantities alone \
II. numeral cards alone\
III. associate quantity and numeral cards

**Materials:**
* 45 of each of these quantities of golden bead material: ones, tens, hundreds, thousands
* box of large wooden decimal numbers 1-9 in green, 10-90 in blue, 100-900 in red, and 1000-9000 in green
* large work rug(s) to accommodate entire decimal layout
* large work rug to serve as a “supply rug” 
* tray for carrying golden beads for the source

**Prerequisites:**
* experience with and understanding of 0-10 number/numeral activities
* introductory tray and building tray

**Direct Aim:**
* form quantities from 1 – 9000 using symbol and quantity
* learn names of quantities 1 – 9000
* understand how to sequence hierarchies and quantities and symbols within each hierarchy

**Indirect Aim:**
* preparation for understanding place value
* preparation for comprehension of larger numbers
* preparation for abstraction

**Age:**  4 – 5 years

**Presentation:**

**Presentation I – quantities alone**

1.  Invite a child to observe the lesson. Unroll two rugs on the floor. The rugs should be touching and should be placed side by side in a vertical orientation.

2.  Ask the child to bring all of the required beads from the golden bead material supply source to a supply rug. (This should be exactly 45 beads.) Place one bead in the upper right hand corner of the rug. Say, "one."

NOTE:  Bringing all the required golden bead material to a supply rug prevents the lesson being disrupted because another student begins to use some of the required beads for another work.

3.  In the space immediately below the one bead, place two beads. Count them as you place them, "One, two." Place them in a vertical column, touching each other.  Plan, so that you know how much space to leave between quantities. This will vary depending on the length of the rug.  When all nine groups of one beads are placed on the rug, they should be evenly spaced. 

{{< figure class="float-right" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image033.webp" alt="Math on Mat" caption="Lay out the quantity first, and then place the numeral cards - order by order">}}

4.  Count and place three one beads in the space below the two beads. They should be placed in a vertical column.  Continue this procedure with the quantities four through nine. Each quantity should be placed in a vertical column, near the right edge of the rug.  Most likely, the child will want to take over counting and placing the beads. Allow him/her to do so, helping as needed. 

5.  After the nine ones are placed, say, “Oh, the tray of ones is empty. After nine comes ten. We will need the box of ten bars now.” 

6.  Starting at the top of the rug, to the left of the one bead, place the first ten bar vertically and say, “One ten.” Continue with “Two tens” Then, continue naming the quantity of tens while placing the increasing groups of tens. Slide the “supply box” of tens down the rug as you place the ten bars for 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90.

7.  After the nine ten bars are placed, say, “Oh, the box of tens is empty. After nine tens comes … ten 10s – that’s one hundred.  Ten 10s is the same as a one hundred square. We will need a tray of 100 squares.” Send the child to bring back a tray of 45 one hundred squares from the supply source. “Now, we start all over again with ‘one’ – one hundred.” Starting at the top of the rug, place the first one hundred square to the left of the one ten bar. Say, “One hundred.” Place two hundred squares under the one hundred square and say, “Two hundred.”

8.  Continue to nine hundreds. Then say, “Oh, our hundreds tray is empty. After nine hundreds comes ten 100s – that’s one thousand. We will need a tray of thousand cubes.” Send the child to get a tray of thousand cubes. The child will need to return to the source several times to refill the tray as the thousands are placed from 1000 to 9000.

9.  “Now we start again with ‘one’ – one thousand!” When the entire layout of quantity is placed on the rug, return to the one bead and name all the quantities with the child. Remember to say, “one ten, two tens,” NOT “ten, twenty.” 

**Presentation II – numeral cards alone**

1.  Invite a child to observe the lesson. Obtain a rug and unroll it on the floor.

2.  Bring the box of large numeral cards to the rug. (In some environments the size of the cards or the rugs may make a second rug necessary for this work. Check this ahead of time.)

3.  Take out the one cards. Place them near the bottom of the rug. Place the one card in the top right corner of the rug.  Point to the one card and say, "One."  Point to the space immediately below it and say, "Two." Find the two card and place it below the one card. “Two.”

4.  Point and count, "One, two…" Say "…three," as you point to the empty space immediately below the two card. Find the three card and place it below the two card in the empty space.

5.  Continue this process, pointing, counting, and then placing the new number card below the existing column of number cards.

6.  When you have placed the nine card say, "After nine comes ten." Remove the ten cards from the box and place them near the bottom of the rug. Point to the space near the top of the rug, just to the left of the one card. Say, "Ten. We will need the ten card next.” Find the ten card and place it on the rug to the left of the one card.

7.  Point to the ten and say, "One ten."  Point to the empty space directly below the ten and say, "Two tens."  Find the card that represents two tens and place it in the space just below the ten (to the left of the two).

8.  Continue placing the tens cards, using the same procedure used to place the first column of cards. Point and count to each new card ("one ten, two tens, three tens...") before selecting and placing it in the column. At this point, do not use "twenty" or "thirty," etc. Allow the child to name and place the numerals if he/she is ready. “Nine tens! What comes after nine tens? Ten tens. And, ten tens is one hundred.”  “We need the hundreds cards next.”

9.  Continue the same procedure with the 'hundred' cards, placing them directly to the left of the 'tens' row. Count and place them, "One hundred, two hundred," etc.

10.  Continue the same procedure with the 'thousand' cards, to the left of the 'hundreds' cards.  Count and place them, "One thousand, two thousand," etc.

{{< img src="/img/math/decimal-system/image035.webp" class="pure-img float-right" alt="Numeral Cards" >}}

11.  When all the cards have been placed in the layout, review them with the child. Point to and read the cards out loud. Encourage the child to read them with you.

12.  Show the child how to stack the cards from each column and return them to the box in order.

**Presentation III – associate quantities with numeral cards**\
Place all quantity for ones, then all cards for ones.\
Next, place all quantity for tens, then all cards for tens. \
Next, place all quantity for hundreds, then all cards for hundreds.\
Finally, place all quantity for thousands, then all cards for thousands.

1.  Unroll multiple rugs on the floor if needed to accommodate the final layout. The rugs should be touching and should be placed side by side in a vertical orientation.

{{< figure class="float-right" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image037.webp" alt="Math on Mat" caption="Presentation III: Associating Quantity & Symbol">}}

2.  Ask the child to bring the large numeral cards and the decimal layout beads to the supply rug. This should include exactly 45 from each hierarchy. Start with the one beads. Place one bead in the upper right hand corner of the rug. Say, "One."

{{< img src="/img/math/decimal-system/image039.webp" class="pure-img float-right" alt="Presentation 3" >}}

3.  In the space immediately below the one bead, place two additional one beads. Count them as you place them, "One, two." Place them in a vertical column, touching each other.  

Plan, so that you know how much space to leave between quantities. This will vary depending on the length of the rug. (The goal is that when all nine groups of one beads are placed on the rug, they should be evenly spaced AND spaced to associate correctly with the soon-to-arrive column of numeral cards.)

{{< img src="/img/math/decimal-system/image041.webp" class="pure-img float-right" alt="Golden Beads" >}}

4.  Count and place three one beads in the space below the two beads. They should be placed in a vertical column.  Continue this procedure with the quantities four through nine. Each quantity should be placed in a vertical column, near the right edge of the rug.  The child will likely want to take over counting and placing the beads. Allow him/her to do so, helping as needed until the set of nine beads is complete. 

5.  Ask the child to bring a large set of ones cards to the rug. Ask the child to place the ones cards next to the quantities. Each card should be placed to the left of the quantity it represents. The cards should be in a column, as in the first presentation. Assist child as needed. When the child places the 9 card, say, “What comes after nine?” (“Ten!”)  So we will need to work with the ten bars now.

{{< img src="/img/math/decimal-system/image043.webp" class="pure-img float-right" alt="Golden Beads with Numerial Cards" >}}

Note:  You may see environments/internet photos that place the cards to the right of the beads. This is not consistent with the decimal layout illustration presented by Maria Montessori on page 15 of Psychoarithmetic (on right) and also is opposite of where we will ask children to place the numeral cards when composing numbers.

6.  Ask the child to return to the bead source and bring all of the ten bars (should be exactly 45).

7.  Point to the nine one beads, and remind the child that after nine, comes ten. Point to the space at the top of the rug, to the left of the one card. “Now, we start all over again with one – one ten.” Place one ten bar in the space, and say, "One ten." The ten bar should be positioned vertically.

8.  Guide the child to place the quantities of ten bars (one ten through nine tens) in a column on the rug. Use the same procedure used to place the unit beads. Count each quantity out loud, "One ten, two tens…" Each new quantity should be placed in a horizontal row (each ten bar should be vertical), in the space just below the previous quantity. The spacing between quantities should be the same as that used for the units because this will allow easy association with the soon-to-arrive ten numeral cards.

9.  When all the ten bars have been placed, retrieve the tens numeral cards.

10.  Place tens cards near the bottom of the rug. Guide the child to placing each numeral card to the left of the quantity it represents. Name the numeral card as it is placed, "One ten, two tens, three tens...nine tens!" (The child may take over.) “Remember, what comes after nine tens?” (“Ten tens!”) “And ten tens is the same as what?” (“100!”)  “So, we will need you to bring the tray of 100 squares.” Then, continue with, “Now we start all over again with one – one hundred!”

11.  Repeat the procedure for the hundred squares and numeral cards, and the thousand cube(s) and numeral cards.  Encourage the child to participate, guiding her/him as needed. Stop at the one thousand cube or continue through to 9000.

NOTE:  For the first presentation, the hundred squares and thousand cubes should be placed side by side, horizontally for each individual quantity so the final layout will appear as in Psychoarithmetic. This layout emphasizes the increasing quantity more clearly – especially for the 100 squares. Future presentations may use other variations.

{{< img src="/img/math/decimal-system/image045.webp" class="pure-img float-right" alt="Golden Beads Layous" >}}

12.  Review the quantities and numerals with the child. 

**Points of Interest:**
* it is a BIG work
* seeing the layout develop
* seeing the size of quantities increase
* feeling the increasing weight of the gold

**Control of Error:**
* the precise quantity of bead material needed
* accurate counting
* visual of stepped increase of quantity

{{< img src="/img/math/decimal-system/image047.webp" class="pure-img float-right" alt="Golden Beads Layous" >}}

**Variations:**
The layout may be done in different ways: 
These images on the right are from montessorialbum.com
The second layout illustrates the move from one hierarchy (9-10, 90-100, 900-1000) to the next nicely because, for example, the nine stacked 100 squares butt up against the first 1000 cube and the idea that 100 is the same as ten tens becomes obvious. 

These two variations also create a reverse number line, of sorts, and are practical for several children to retrieve quantities and symbols at the same time.

Support “10 frame” thinking with a layout variation that begins a second column when working with the six through nine quantities.  Five objects are placed in a vertical column and the 6th bead is placed to the right of the number 1 bead- a “10 frame” layout.

A variation which is quite common, perhaps because it is a “space saver” and “rug saver,” is the vertical arrangement of the bead material. Here, the vertical layout is shown for Presentation I and Presentation III. These photos also show the “10 frame” layout of the unit beads.

**Extensions:**
* Fetching numerals or quantities
* Composing numbers
* Exchange game
* Gathering numerals and quantities for Operations

**Vocabulary:**\
“the same as,” numeral names, descriptive names of the quantities

### The Bank Game

Fetching different quantities and then quantities & symbols.\
“Go to the bank and get _______.”

**NOTE:**  This is a series of lessons which should be repeated often until mastery is reached. The golden bead source and decimal card layout set up may remain ‘out and active’ in the classroom throughout the work cycle. More than one child may be “sent” at a time to fetch quantities, numeral cards, or both. 

I. fetching quantities\
II. fetching numeral cards\
III. fetching numeral cards and corresponding quantities

**Materials:**
* decimal numeral cards
* golden bead material
* tray 

**Prerequisites:**\
knowledge of;1-10 activities, decimal numeral cards, decimal quantities, how to read decimal numeral cards, how to build decimal layout

**Direct Aim:**\
to practice and demonstrate ability to accurately fetch/collect quantities of bead material from a golden bead material source when given a verbal command or when given numeric symbols.

to practice and demonstrate ability to accurately fetch/collect numeral cards from a layout when given a verbal command or given a quantity of gold.

**Indirect Aim:**
* understand the structure of the decimal system
* understand the role of zero in place value
* prepare to understand and use larger numbers
* prepare for assembling materials needed for four operations

**Age:** 3.5 – 4.5

**Presentations:**
**Presentation I:  Quantity Fetching from the “bank” after a verbal cue.**

1.  Invite child to retrieve a tray used to carry golden bead material – show child where to find these trays in the classroom.  Collect a “bank” of golden bead material for a source rug. Place this source rug across the room from you and the child. Tell the child that this is the “BANK” with the golden bead material.

**NOTE:**  Some environments create a sign that says “BANK” and display it on the source rug.

2.  “Please go to the bank and get four ones.”  Confirm that child understood:  “How many ones did I ask you to get?” Child should respond, “Four ones.”

3.  When the child returns, ask, “What did you bring back from the bank?” Child should say, “Four ones.”  

4.  Ask the child to count the quantity from the tray onto the work rug. Count with the child. If child has too few, invite the child to return to the bank, “You may return to the bank if you need more.”  Or, if they have too much, “You may take some back to the bank if you need to.”

5.  “Now, can you take these four ones back to the bank and bring me two tens?”  “How much will you bring back?” OR, you may need to break this request into two separate trips. “Take these four ones back to the bank.”  Then, when child returns, “Please bring me two tens.”

**NOTE:**  Observe to determine if work rug should be moved closer to source. If accuracy is a challenge, you may isolate the “remembering” piece from the “counting the quantity” piece by inviting an older child to serve as the banker.  The child would ask the banker, “Can you give me four ones, please.”  “I need two tens now.  Here are the four ones.”

6.  As child becomes more confident and accurate, expand the request to include quantities from more than one hierarchy. “Please bring me two tens and five ones.”  “Please bring me one hundred and five tens.”  Count the quantity from the tray onto the rug each time.

**Process:**  Teachers asks.  Child repeats.  Child fetches & returns.  Teacher asks again.  Child confirms again.  Child counts quantity onto rug. 




**Presentation II – Numeral Card Fetching from a decimal card layout after a verbal cue.**\
1.  Invite child to work with you to set up a card-only decimal layout on a rug using the small numeral cards.

**NOTE:** The small cards work well here because the large numeral cards are used for “answers” in the upcoming operations lessons, except for subtraction, when the large cards are used for the minuend. Usually, when composing numbers for golden bead operations, the child will be using the small numeral cards – so it makes sense to practice with these. 

2.  Follow the same process as Presentation I:

Ask the child to retrieve a number card. “Bring me the two tens card."
Ask child to confirm what you asked. “What did I ask you to bring me?”  Child: “The card that says two tens.”

3.  Child goes to decimal card layout with tray and retrieves card and returns to work rug.

Teacher asks again, “What did you bring?”

Child confirms again, “The card that says two tens.”

4. Teacher invites child to place card on the rug.  “Yes. This says two tens.”  If it is the wrong card, identify the card and repeat the request. “This card says two hundreds. Can you bring me the card that says two tens?”

**Presentation III – Fetching quantity from the “bank” using numeral card provided from decimal card layout as a cue. (association)**

1.  Work with child to set up (small wooden) card-only decimal layout on one rug – near the work rug. Review names with child. Complete a three period lesson to assess retention of the names of the numerals on the number card.  If the child struggles, do not continue with Presentation III – return to Presentation II.

2.  Set up a “bank” of decimal material on another rug, some distance from the work rug.

3.  Place a number card from the decimal layout on the child’s tray. “What does this say?”  
“Please go to the bank and get this quantity on your tray.”

4.  When the child returns, ask them to count the quantity from the tray onto the work rug. Say, “This is ____.”  “Does the card say ____?”  Ask the child to place the card on the work rug to the left of the bead quantity. (The card will also be to the left of quantity for future golden bead operations so it is good to start this procedure.)

After retrieving single quantities, place two cards on the child’s tray, then three, then four – from the different hierarchies. The cards are separate on the tray – not composed.

5.  After practicing with the numeral card(s) on the tray, you may challenge the child to leave the card(s) on the work rug after retrieving them from the decimal layout. Then, the child will ‘hold the numerals in his/her mind’ when going to fetch the quantity. Remember to ask the child to say the numeral name and repeat the quantity that will be retrieved.

NOTE:  Presentation III can easily flow into the upcoming number composition lesson.  

**Points of Interest:**
* challenge of remembering request
* fetching from the bank – movement
* using the golden bead material

**Control of Error:**
* teacher
* child’s experience with exchange game

**Variations:**

**Extensions:**
* number composition
* reading composed numbers

### Number Composition

Extending the Bank Game:  introduces zero as a place holder and shows how numbers are composed AND written.

**Materials:**
* golden bead material “Bank” staged as a supply source
* decimal card layout (small cards)
* tray 
* work rug to hold collected cards and golden bead material
* number composition paper
* green, red, and blue pencils

**Prerequisites:**
* mastery of retrieving and reading individual decimal layout cards
* accurately fetches given quantities (verbal & numeral cards as cues)

**Direct Aim:**
* to understand how the different numeral card hierarchies come together to compose a number
* to illustrate the concept of place value 
* to introduce the concept of using zero as a place holder

**Indirect Aim:**
* practice using place value concepts
* prepare to work with larger numbers
* prepare to move to abstraction

**Age:** (4.5) 5 years

{{< figure class="float-right" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image083.webp" alt="Number Composition 1" >}}

**Presentations:**
**Presentation I: stacking numeral cards while still “peeking” at the zeros**

Offer this presentation after the child is successful with fetching numeral cards.

1.  Work with four numeral cards, one from each order.  Provide the cards or send the child to fetch them on a tray from the decimal numeral card layout.

2.  Ask the child to fetch the golden bead material that corresponds with each numeral card.  The child may take the numeral cards on his/her tray or leave the cards on the rug and remember the quantity.

3.  When the child returns, organize the cards and beads on the work rug.  The cards are placed vertically/in a column, not touching each other, on the left side of the rug.  The gold is placed to the right of the corresponding number, horizontally, with the thousands first, then the hundreds, tens, and ones. (The cards and golden bead material are organized in this way, cards left & gold right, because it is how the child will be asked to organize the cards and beads when doing operations in the future.)

{{< figure class="float-right" src="/img/math/decimal-system/image085.webp" alt="Number Composition 2" >}}

4.  Ask the child to tell you what they fetched. “What does this say?” while pointing to card. Then, “How much is this?” while pointing to the corresponding quantity.

5.  “Yes, this says ___ thousand, ___ hundreds, ___ tens, and ___ ones.”

6.   “Let me show you how to make the cards say the same number without using all these zeros.” (point)  “When we do this, we always start with the largest numeral.”  Point to the highest order – the thousand card. 

7.  “Then, we go to the next largest (point to the 100 card) and move it up. The hundred covers the three zeros of the thousand.” (point to the 10 card) “Next, the ten covers the two zeros in the hundred.” (point to the 1 card) “And the one covers the one zero in the ten.”

8.  “This still says, ___ thousand, ___ hundreds, ___ tens, and ___ ones.” 
“LOOK. PEEK RIGHT HERE.” (Tilt the cards up and separate a little so the zeros are visible.)

**NOTE:** “All these zeros were saving a spot for these other numbers. The thousand’s zeros saved a spot for the ___hundred. The hundred’s zeros saved a spot for ten tens. _The ten’s zero saved a spot for _10__ones. But, we have these numbers now, so the zeros’ job is done. They don’t need to show anymore.”

9.  Leave the composed number to the left of the bead material. If the child is interested, repeat the process. Invite the child to compose the number by stacking the cards, starting with the largest numeral card as the base and moving to the smallest numeral card last.

**Presentation II: writing down a composed number**
1.  After the child completes a review of Presentation I, offer, “Today we will practice writing down the quantities you retrieved from the bank.”  “We will use a special paper and we will need a green, blue, and red pencil.” (It is important to show the child the source for these materials so take the child with you to gather these items.)
2.  Use the four numeral cards and the corresponding quantities of golden bead material from the review task. “When we write a number, we start with the largest kind of number.”

Point to the thousand numeral card – 3000. “We will write 3000 here with a green pencil.” (demonstrate) “Thousands are the largest kind of number here.” 

3.  “Next largest is the hundred card – this card says five hundred.  We will write 500 here with a red pencil.”  (demonstrate) 

**HINT:** If you point to the bottom edge of the 3 in the thousands place on the paper with your left pointer finger and say, “This is the thousands place in the first box. We can’t start writing 500 here.”  Then your finger covers up that first box – the thousand’s place. Then, point to the correct box with your right pointer finger – the hundred’s place (still with the left finger covering the first box) and say, “THIS is the hundred’s place. We will start writing 500 here.”
Repeat this for each order the first several presentations. 

4.  “Next largest is the ten card – this card says four tens.  We will write 40 here with the blue pencil.” (demonstrate)

5.  “The smallest is the ones card – this card says eight ones.  We will write 8 here with the green pencil.” (demonstrate)

6.   Now, compose the numeral cards, starting with the thousand as the base card.\
“This is the number we write in the bottom space.”\
“This tells us how much but without all the zeros – remember all those zeros that were saving spots for the other numbers.”(point to the zeros on the paper)

**Points of Interest:**
* Moving the cards to compose number
* Peeking at the zeros
* Using colored pencils
* Playing the game, saying, “No, no, no, you can’t put it there. That’s not its place!”

**Control of Error:**
* teacher
* child’s past practice with the decimal system

**Variations:**\
When writing the number, play the “Where to write the number?” game. When poising the pencil above the paper, hover over different squares for writing the number. “Can I write 300 here on my paper? No? That is the ten’s place!”  “Can I write the 300 here on my paper? No? That’s the one’s place!” “How about this spot? Is this the hundred’s place?”  (and so on…)

Select bead material first and then ask child to write the corresponding number on the paper.

Have no quantity in some of the orders – so, the space saving zero(s) remains visible.

**Extensions:**
* reading composed numbers
* golden bead operations

**Vocabulary:**
* review names of cards and quantities
* adding idea of place value with “this is the place for”

### Reading Composed Numbers

Extending the Bank Game:  shows how to read (and de-compose) an already-composed number.

**Materials:**\
a set of nine command cards with four-digit, color-coded numbers: green thousand, red hundred, blue ten, green one  

**NOTE:** These cards should be made to be the same size as a thousand card from the decimal layout cards – so it is easy to associate the command card with the composed number.  An easy way to create this material is to photocopy the large numeral cards. Cut out the copied cards, then compose four digit numbers with the paper numeral cards. – stacking the 100, 10, and 1 order numerals on top of the selected numeral from the 1000 order. Laminate this stack of paper numeral cards. These are the command cards.

* golden bead material set up as source on a rug
* decimal layout numeral cards on a rug
* tray and a work rug

**Prerequisites:**
Child should be able to accurately read un-composed numerals and fetch the corresponding quantities of golden beads, AND then compose the number accurately.

**Direct Aim:**
* to review and reinforce number composition activities
* to practice reading 

**Indirect Aim:**
* expand experience with place value
* prepare to work with larger numbers
* prepare to complete operations with golden bead material
* help move toward abstraction

**Age:** 5 years

**Presentation:**
1.  Choose one command card and demonstrate how to (de)compose the number on the card using the decimal layout cards and then compose them again, OR use a number already composed by the child. Ask the child to tell you what the composed number cards say. The child may need to peek at the zeros at first.

2.  Ask the child to fetch the corresponding quantity of golden bead material from the Bank, then ask the child to look at golden bead material and tell you how much they collected. 

3.  Ask child to arrange the golden bead material as presented in past lessons. Observe. The child should place golden bead material to the right of the composed number, in correct hierarchical order.

5.  Continue with the other command cards, as long as the child shows interest.

**Points of Interest:**
* reading a large number independently – very exciting
* composing and de-composing numbers independently
* movement – collecting golden beads

**Control of Error:**
* Teacher (or older child)
* Accurate observation by teacher to determine readiness

**Variations:**
* choose cards from decimal layout rug
* have an older child choose decimal layout cards or write out a command card number 

**Extensions:**
Write the number to read as a “secret message” on a piece of paper – child takes the paper to the gold source and collects the gold.

Work with two children – give one child a “secret message” to read (not show) to another child. The child listens to the number, repeats it, and then collects the gold from the source. When the child returns, both children check for accuracy.

### Exchange Games
Practice exchanging quantities between hierarchies.

**Materials:**
* quantity of golden bead material on a tray (this will be gathered by the child from the shelf) ten ones, nine tens, nine hundreds
* container for the one beads
* thousand cube that remains on the shelf
* work rug

**Prerequisites:**
* experience with decimal layout – golden bead material & numeral cards
* understanding of numeral activities 1-10
* coordination
* concentration

**Direct Aim:**
* practice exchange procedure
* experience with the relationship between orders of the decimal system

**Indirect Aim:**
* prepare for dynamic operations
* prepare for abstraction

**Age:** 4-5

**Presentation(s):**\
**Presentation I:  basic exchange game lesson with golden bead material**

1.  Ask the child to set out a work rug. Walk to the decimal layout material on the shelf. Give the child the tray holding a small container. Ask him/her to place ten one beads in the container on the tray. Then, ask the child to place nine tens on the tray. Finally, ask the child to place nine hundreds on the tray. “We will leave the thousand cubes on the shelf.”  Point to the thousands cubes.

2.  Bring the bead-filled tray to the rug and place the beads on the rug.  Start with the ones. Place the tens to the left of the ones. Place the hundreds to the left of the tens.

3.  Ask the child to count the ones. "Remember, ten ones is the same as one ten bar. Take the ten ones back to the shelf and exchange them for one ten bar." Place the beads in the container and invite the child to return to the shelf for the exchange. Ask the child to place the new, exchanged-for, ten bar with the nine existing ten bars. Then, ask the child to count the ten bars on the rug.

4.  “Remember, ten tens is the same as one hundred.  Take the ten tens back to the shelf, and exchange them for a one hundred square.” Wait for the child to complete this task. When the child returns, place the new, exchanged-for, hundred square with the nine existing one hundred squares on the rug.

5.  Ask the child to count the hundred squares. There will be ten. "Remember, ten hundreds is the same as one thousand. Take the ten hundreds back to the shelf and return with one thousand." Wait for the child to complete this task.

6.  "Let’s exchange some more of this gold. Take the thousand back to the shelf and exchange it for ten hundreds." Wait for the child to complete this task.

7.  "Let’s get some tens. Take one hundred back and exchange it for ten tens." Wait for the child to return. 

8.  “Let’s get some units. Take one ten back and exchange it for ten units." Wait for the child to return.

9.  Continue to practice and offer opportunity to demonstrate skill level by reducing detail level of directions.  For example, “Exchange this 100 for 10s.”  Observe to see if the child brings back ten 10 bars. 

10.  Further increase the difficulty by asking, “Go exchange this one hundred square. I’ll wait to see what you bring back.”

**Presentation II:  “How much is on my tray?”**

This lesson is an adaptation from a lesson by Martha McDermott appearing in the Xavier Montessori Teacher Education Program 2010 album revision. It is adapted here to better align with an exercise described in Montessori’s Psychoarithmetic on page 48.

1.  Place a significant quantity of each order on a tray. Not arranged in any particular order.
NOTE:  The child may collect the quantity by asking non-working children, “Can you put some ten bars (or one beads, or hundred squares, or thousand cubes) on my tray?”  If the child asks “How many?” the child may tell them, or say, “You decide.”

No more than a few thousand cubes should be gathered because if the child ends up with ten thousand cubes, they cannot complete an exchange.

2.  When the child has at least some golden bead material from each order, and is satisfied with the amount, invite them to sort the quantity on the work rug. The child may organize the beads by first grouping by type, and then placing in correct hierarchical order with thousands on the far left of the rug, then hundreds, then tens, then ones.

3.  “Well, to find out how much you have, you’ll need to start counting.”  “Don’t forget the rule, no more than nine can remain loose, so ‘When you get to ten, you need to stop and exchange.’”  

4.  Observe the child. Does the child start with the ones?  Does the child count into his/her hand?  Does the child stop at ten and go to the shelf to exchange?  Does the child return with the correct quantity and combine it with the correct order?  Does the child exchange the final few beads even when he/she does not have ten? This is a good assessment activity.

5.  When the child can no longer exchange in the order being considered, then the quantity in that order can be assigned a numerical value using the numeral cards, or by writing the number on a small piece of paper (numeral card is preferred).  Place the number next to the remaining bead material in that order.

6.  Invite the child to continue with each order; counting, exchanging, then assigning the number to record the amount remaining in the order after all exchanging is completed.

7.  When all orders have been counted, the child should compose the numeral cards and read the resulting number.  Invite the child to write the number.

NOTE:  This exchanging-focused lesson is a natural precursor to addition with the golden beads. As the child collects beads placed on the tray by several different children and then organizes the mountain of beads; the child is adding together these separate smaller quantities into one, larger, quantity.  Essentially, that is addition.

**Presentation III:**  “Hand-full Exchange Game,” to practice counting into the hand and completing a two-handed exchange when a quantity of ten is reached. Two handed exchanging will be used later, in dynamic operations.

This is a teacher-led activity that several children can play at the same time. 

**Materials needed:**\
A large bowl of objects such as (cleaned) pennies, small wooden beads, small pom-poms, glass stones, or other objects that a child has a reasonable chance of holding at least 10 in the palm of his/her hand.

A small bowl of related objects the child will receive when exchanging.  For example, a dime when exchanging ten pennies, a large glass stone when exchanging ten small glass stones, a large pom-pom when exchanging ten small pom-poms.

A felt mat or placemat to place in front of each child to designate a spot for their own objects. This helps prevent confusion about which objects “belong” to which child.

**Rules of the game:**
Two main rules: “Number one: when you get to ten, you need to stop and exchange.” “Number two: you must use two hands when you exchange.”

(Demonstrate as you show the children. You should have a counting mat too.)
“When it is your turn, you may reach one hand into the large bowl and grasp as many objects as you can hold. Then, place the objects on your counting rug.”

“Next, you count objects into your hand, one at a time. (One, two, three, four, five…) Remember, when I get to ten, I will STOP and exchange – using TWO hands. (six, seven, eight, nine, TEN!)  Watch how I exchange using two hands.”

Demonstrate by holding the hand grasping the ten objects over the large bowl AND holding your empty hand over the small bowl. “My two hands are ready for the exchange.”

Then, say “Ex-chaaaaa-nge” as you, at the same time, drop the ten objects back into the large bowl with one hand AND pick up one object from the small bowl with the other hand.

The child places the exchanged-for object on his/her counting rug.

NOTE: The teacher will need to adjust the bowl placement for the children so they do not need to cross arms to get the correct hand over the correct bowl. 

**Points of Interest:**
* When all presentations are considered:
* movement
* asking other children to put gold on tray
* game-like feel of the work
* several children involved
* trying to grasp as many objects as possible
* two-handed exchange

**Control of Error:**
* teacher
* prior experience with decimal layout materials

**Variations:**
* Money exchange games using dice: 
* base ten option with pennies, dimes, and dollars
* OR base five option with pennies, nickels, quarters, half dollars, and dollars 
* OR dedicated tray of golden beads with a box of units, a box of ten bars and a box of hundred squares

**Extensions:**\
Presentation II and Presentation III may be considered extensions.

**Vocabulary:**
* exchange, two-handed exchange
* variations introduce money vocabulary

#### The “Little Bank” Game

This is an assessment tool for decimal system presentations and practice with relationships between quantities, symbols, and hierarchical relationships. 

**Materials:**
* Quantity of decimal material to create a Little Bank – nine each of 1s, 10s, 100s, and at least one thousand cube – laid out on a rug
* Small numeral cards that correspond to the created Little Bank – laid out on a separate rug
* Tray

### MAKING A NUMBER ROLL

(We will create a sample number roll at Face to Face and then students should complete the write-up.)

**Materials:** roll of fabric with the outline of numerals, numerals that fit the outline on the rug, (optional as an extension: small stones/gems to place the correct quantity of inside the numeral outline)

**Prerequisites:** work with the bead stair, linear counting, numerals and counters

**Direct Aim:** To match numerals to their corresponding place on the number line, to recognize and name the numerals 0-10

**Indirect Aim:** to develop the understanding that 0 is an important number that receives nothing, to prepare for the 45 layout

**Age:** 3.5-4

**Presentation:**
1. Show the child where the number line, basket of numerals (and basket of 45 small items) is stored
2. Unroll the number roll in the same fashion as you unroll any work rug in the classroom
3. Retrieve a second rug and unroll (preparing a place for the basket of numerals)
4. Retrieve the basket of numerals and bring to the number roll
5. Point to the 1 and say, “This says 1.  I need the numeral 1.”  
6. Search for the numeral 1 in the basket, repeating “1” to yourself as you search.  When you find it, nod your head.  Bring the numeral 1 to the numeral roll, placing it with care inside the outline on the rug.
7. Now point to the 2, then search for the two in the same way you searched for the one, placing it carefully within the outline on the rug.
8. Repeat the same steps all the way through the numeral 10.
9. State, “We still have the numeral 0 on the rug.  We saved it for last, because it is a very special number.  You’ll see.”

**Points of Interest:** The numerals are large and made of wood….this is a similar lesson to the alphabet roll, but with less numerals to match than there were letters.
Control of Error: The numerals in the basket match the outline on the rug, 

**Variations:**

**Extensions:** Have a basket of 45 small items, such as pinecones, seashells, gems, etc. for the child to practice placing one on the one, two on the two, 3 on the three, etc.  Consider using small paper dots that the guide places on each numeral to help the child practice 1:1 correspondence if needed as extra assistance at first, until the child has internalized the quantity corresponding with each numeral.

**Vocabulary:** numeral line, quantity,
