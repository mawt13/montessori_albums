## Earth: Our Home

### WHAT IS A MODEL?{.redc}

**Materials:**
- Objects that are reproductions of real things. Examples include: a car, an elephant, a flower, etc. The object should have design detail and attributes (weight, texture, color) so as to initiate a conversation about its status as a “model.”
- Small, life-like items
- Basket for the models 
- Cloth to cover the items in the basket

**Prerequisites:**
- None other than ability to join a lesson and observe and attend

**Direct Aim: (Practical)**
- To show the child that we make and use models to learn about something instead of using the real thing; a representation stands in for the real object.
- To introduce the concept of a model
- To show that we use models to identify the characteristics of real things; they are especially useful when the real object is too big to hold or bring indoors. 

**Indirect Aims: (Developmental)**
- To prepare the student for using models of the Earth, maps of the earth and other cultural materials such as flags, zoology puzzles etc. 
- To prepare for the introducing the globes
- To isolate certain concepts by using models

**Age:** 3-5 

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**

**Sensorial Level:**  A “real” and “not real” work could be done on a sensorial level. 	For example, a “real” flower and an artificial flower could be included in the basket, as well as a “real” and “not real” apple, a “real” and “not real” specimen of an insect (the real insect could be enclosed in a transparent container), etc. The items could be explored without words, or questions can be posed, i.e., “Which flower is real?” “Which apple is real?” “Which insect is real?”	

**Naming/Concept Level:**  The presentation below is on this level.  Vocabulary is stressed and the concept of a “model” is introduced. 

**Higher Order Thinking Level:**  The idea of learning about real entities by using models can be practiced. For example, by looking at the globe, the child may first state what can be learned from examining the globe.  The Earth is made of land and water with air all around.  There is more water on the surface of the Earth than land.  The Earth spins at a tilt.  Later this information may be recorded using various formats.

**Presentation:**  WHAT IS A MODEL?

1.  Invite the child being sure to name the work.  For example, “Today, I would like to show you “model” work.  Will you please join me?”
2.  Announce the name of the Lesson and the name of the work. Designate a work area. 
3.  Carry the basket of covered items to the work area and conveniently place the basket to the child’s dominant side for easy access. (If working with a child with difficulty with left to right directionality, consider placing the basket in the upper left corner of the work area.) 
4. Remove the elephant from under the cloth without revealing other objects.  Ask, “What is this?”  If the response is “an elephant,” ask, “Is it a real elephant?”  Engage their interest by telling them that you could not possibly bring in a “real” elephant. “Why not?” Point out that it is a “model” of an elephant.  Say, “Sometimes real things cannot be brought into the classroom, but we can learn about them by using models.”  If the child responds that the elephant is a “model,” begin the conversation about the usefulness of models for learning.
5. Optional: At this point, you may want to invite the child(ren) to hold and examine the model object in their own hands.
6. Ask, “What can we learn about elephants by examining (looking at /touching) this model?”  Answers may include that the elephant is heavy, it is gray, it has wrinkles, it has four legs and tusks, etc.
7.  Reiterate, “We can learn about things by looking at models.”  Place the model elephants 			on the work area.
8. Remove another small object from the basket of life-like objects.  Ask, “What is this?” [a doll] Note that a doll is a model of a person.  Ask, “What can we learn about people by looking at this doll?” Answers may include that people have two eyes, two ears, hair on the head, two 		arms, two legs, ten fingers, etc.  
9. Again, reiterate that models are not real, but we can learn about real things by 				looking at them closely.  
10.  If interest is maintained, remove other “models” from the basket and talk about what can be learned by examining the model closely.
11. Allow the child to explore the models and to share any further observations.  
12. Return the models to the basket and cover with the cloth.
13.  Pose a closing question, “What did we do today with this material?”  If needed, supply a concise answer, “We learned that we can learn about real things by using models.”
14.   Return the material to the shelf. [One suggestion for where to keep the model work is on the top of the map cabinet with the globes or, if the globes are on a different shelf, place the model work to the left of Land and Water globe; thus, the work that precedes this first globe lesson.]

**Points of Interest:**
- Covering the items in the basket with a cloth 
- Naming/calling the items “models”
- Noting how real the models look and feel compared to the real items 		
- Using their imagination to think of a model 
- Identifying the details depicted on the models

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher
- The familiarity of the items 

**Variations:**
- Instruct the child to reach into the covered basket and identify the objects before they are taken out of the basket.  How did s/he know what they were?  A discussion of the usefulness of models would then follow.

**Extensions:**
- Place additional models in the basket or in a mystery bag.
- Ask the child to look around the room for something that is a model.	

**Vocabulary:**\
Model, representation, three-dimension(al), miniature, names of the parts of the object - elephant/doll  etc.

### LAND AND WATER GLOBE (ALSO KNOWN AS GLOBE 1 AND/OR SANDPAPER GLOBE){.redc}

**Materials:**
- Globe which has land represented with a sandy (rough), light brown surface, and water represented by a smooth, blue surface.  The base holds the globe at a 23.5-degree angle to demonstrate the Earth’s axial tilt, or simply ‘tilt’. See Glossary of terms for more information on axial tilt 

**Prerequisites:**
- Model lesson

**Direct Aims:**
- Build awareness that Earth is a sphere.
- Build awareness that Earth is made of water, land, and has air all around.
- Build awareness that Earth is the planet that we live on.

**Indirect Aim:**  
- Preparation for all areas of study in the Cultural Studies curriculum:  galaxies, solar system, Earth systems, biomes, biology, zoology, geography, cultural comparisons, art.

**Age:** 3 - 5 

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**

- Sensorial Level:
- Naming/Concept Level:
- Higher Order Thinking Level:


**Presentation I:** WATER, LAND, & AIR

**Preparation:**\
The “sensitizing fingers” presentation may be done in conjunction with this presentation; however, this presentation was likely already presented with the Sensorial Touch Boards.  Materials for “sensitizing fingers” include small tray, small pitcher, small bowl, cloth or sponge, small waterproof mat.

**Materials:**
- Land and Water globe
- Chowkie, work rug or mat  (Lesson can be for one child or a small group of three)

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the child to the presentation.  Be enticing in a way that exudes excitement.  “I would like to show you the Sandpaper Globe work!  Will you please join me? I am going to show you how to carry it, so you can carry it back to the shelf!”  Thank the child for coming to lesson.
2. Instruct the child to follow you to the shelf where the Land and Water globe is located.      
Demonstrate how to carry the globe carefully by holding the base with one hand and  
   securing the top of the sphere with the other hand.  Walk slowly with slow, exaggerated steps, looking at the globe to emphasize care. Lean/ lower your body and softly place the globe on the work area (a low table or chowki works well for this lesson). 
3. Announce the name of the lesson and the name of the work.  As always, the extent of words used will depend upon the child and the level of presentation that is appropriate.  You may refer to the lesson for the concept of models, and say, “Remember we had the model lesson of the elephant?”  “This is a globe.  A globe is model of Earth.  Earth is the planet we live on.  Earth is our home!” (Optional:  If the child has had the Geometric Solids presentation, consider asking what shape the globe is; otherwise, discuss the shape and ask the child if s/he can find anything in the classroom with the same shape.  Name the shape a sphere.)
4. Note that before touching the globe, fingers will be sensitized.  Return to the shelf 
     to locate the “sensitizing fingers” work and take this work to the work area.  Place the   
     mat and tray conveniently on the work area; remove the items from the tray; then    
     take the pitcher to the water source and partially fill it.  Pour the water into the small     
     bowl.  Dip fingertips into the bowl of water then dry them with the sponge or cloth.  
5. Point to and trace the smooth blue areas on the globe and say, “The blue areas 
     show the water on Earth.”  Invite the child to touch the smooth blue surface areas 
     and to identify the blue areas as water.  OR, some children may be asked, “What do 
     you think the blue on the globe represents?” 
6   Point to and trace the sandy surface areas of the globe and say, “The rough, sandy
     areas show the land.”  Invite the child to touch the rough areas and to identify them 
     as land.  OR, some children may be asked, “What do you think the rough, tan areas
     on the globe represent?”    
7. Make a circular motion around the globe with one of your hands while saying, “All around the Earth is something we need, but we cannot see.  The Earth is surrounded by air.  We breathe the air.”  Ask the child to show where the air is and ask the child to repeat the word air.  (Option:  Depending upon the child s/he could be told that air also goes inside parts of the Earth...like inside caves and even in the soil.)
8. Point to the elements that make up planet Earth.  Ask, “What did we learn about our  
Earth today?”   If no response, model a concise answer, “Our planet, planet Earth, is made of water and land, and is surrounded by air.”  Thank the child for coming to lesson.
9. Return the globe to the shelf using the same manner described in Step 2 to carry the globe. Or, continue with the three-period lesson described in Presentation II next. 

**Presentation II:**  THREE-PERIOD LESSON

1.  Invite the child to the presentation.  Thank the child for coming to lesson.
2.  Designate a work area. Announce the name of the Lesson and the name of the work. (If you are going to present a deeper level of content with specific vocabulary, you can say, “This is Earth’s axis lesson.” 
3. If this presentation immediately follows Presentation I, invite the child to carry the globe to the work area using two hands as demonstrated previously.  Sensitize fingers, if needed.
4. Review and point to the specific areas as each is mentioned, “The smooth blue areas of the globe show us Earth’s water.  The rough brown/ tan areas show the land.  All around Earth is air.”
5.   Request that the child...
	“Show where the air is.”
	“Point to the water parts.”
	“Rub the land parts.”
6. Point to the sandy surface and ask, “What is this?”
     Point to the smooth blue surface and ask, “What is this?”
     Make a circular motion around the globe and ask, “What is all around the Earth?”
7. Option:  Invite the child to ask questions or to share observations about the globe or about Earth, or ask guided questions, e.g. “Do you see more water or more land on the globe?”  “Where is the largest area of land? Where is the smallest area of land?” 
8. Explore the tilt of the globe and the direction Earth spins. Depending on the child and on readiness/attention, you can show them the globe and the axis. Show how we slowly and carefully remove the globe from the axis rod that is in the base. (Some Montessori globes do not do allow this. If you are purchasing one, we suggest getting one that shows the axis since it demonstrates the tilt so clearly.) Tell them that we will learn more about this later but that for now they can remember that Earth is tilted on its axis.
9. Thank the child for coming to the lesson.

**Points of Interest:**
- Colors on the globe
- Textures on the globe
- Shape of the globe
- Tilt of the globe
- The globe being a model of our planet

**Control of Error:**
- Colors of the land and water
- Teacher, other children

**Variations:**
- Depending upon the child, the initial presentation could begin with an exploration of prior knowledge, e.g. draw attention to the globe and ask, “What do you think this is?”  If the response demonstrates an understanding that the globe is a model of Earth, continue by asking, “What do you think the blue parts are?  What is the sandy part?  What is all around the Earth?”
- Compare the amount of water and land.
- Spin the globe and point out that Earth is tilted. 
- Introduce more vocabulary (axis, tilt, rotation, constant tilt and always towards the sun) 
- Discuss/define “horizon” and note that sometimes the curved shape of Earth can be detected/seen when looking at the horizon. 

**Extensions:**
- Show pictures of the Earth taken by satellite.
- Invite them to make a Land and Water globe booklet.
- Discuss how people travel in/on water, on land, and in the air.

**Vocabulary:**\
Model, globe, land, water, air, horizon (if this is discussed), tilt (if this is discussed), axis (if this is discussed), more/less (if comparing water and land on Earth’s surface)

Song: Air, Land, and Water\
MP3 on Canvas

**Lyrics to the song:**\
Air, land and water,\
Air, land and water,\
Make up our planet.

Air, land and water,\
Air, land and water,\
Make up our planet.

And the sun, and we have what we need to live,\
Need to live,\
Need to live.

And the sun, and we have what we need to live,\
Air, land and water.

### EARTH’S ELEMENTS: LAND, WATER & AIR SPECIMENS (FIRE optional){.redc}

**Materials:**
* Land and Water globe
* Three identical, clear small bottles or containers
* Labels: Water, Land, Air
* Small scoop
* Small funnel (if needed) 
* Plastic work mat (optional) 
* Pitcher of water (if lesson presentation is done outdoors and there is not a water source immediately available.)
* Concrete item such as clip or necklace to indicate that the child is leaving the classroom to get a specimen outdoors (optional). 
* Candle and lighter (or battery-operated candle) if the fourth element, fire is going to be used.

**Prerequisites:** 
- Land and Water globe
- Lessons on procedures for leaving the classroom; for getting water from the tap or classroom water source
- Twisting and turning works in Practical Life

**Direct Aims:**
- To provide concrete representation of the concepts of land, water and air 
- To connect the concepts of land, water and air to their everyday life
- To identify variations of land, air and water on Earth

**Indirect Aim:**  
- To prepare for experiment works connected with the Physical Sciences
- To practice Practical Life skills
- To encourage flexible thinking skills (i.e. soil from a potted plant in the classroom also offers an opportunity to get “land” without going outside.
- To prepare for other areas of the Cultural studies such as  land and water forms, water cycle,  volcanoes, botany and zoology etc.

**Age:** 3 - 5

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**

**Sensorial Level:**  wet and dry experiences with water and land; clear and opaque comparisons with water, air and land; colors and textures of the specimens

**Naming/Concept Level:**  naming the specimens; naming variations of land, such as “dirt”, “soil”, and ‘humus’. 

**Higher Order Thinking Level:**  various sources and names for each of these three elements that are the same; concept of specimen; colleting other examples of the same specimens in different forms and containers

**Presentation:**  EARTH’S ELEMENTS: SPECIMENS

1. Invite the child to the presentation.  Thank the child for coming to lesson. You may choose to do this entire lesson outdoors with a small group of children. You will need to bring the Land and Water globe and perhaps a pitcher of water. This lesson is written so the first presentation is outdoors. 
2. Sit down outside arranging the items on a work rug or plastic mat. 
3. Ask the children to show you the Earth. Ask the children to show you the model of the Earth. Ask the children to show you land on the globe. Then, ask them to show you land outside. You can give them other names for “land” such as soil, dirt. Fill the bottle with land and put the top on. Pass the bottle around if this helps maintain interest and attention.
4. Tell the children that in addition to using models to learn about our world, we use “specimens” to help us learn. “A specimen is an individual example of one whole kind of a natural item.” This is a specimen of land from our school; an individual example of the whole kind of land here at our school.  This work is called, Earth’s Elements: Land, water and air specimens.
5. Place the bottle of the land specimen in a prominent place in the work area. Take the label that says “land” and say, as placing the placing it in front of the bottle, “This says “land” so, I am placing it here in front of our land specimen. 
6. Ask the children to show you the water in the globe. “Now, we need to get water and air specimens. To get a water specimen, we will use our pitcher we brought outside.” Using the funnel if needed, pour the water slowly into the bottle, checking regularly as the volume level increases. Put the top on and place it in a prominent place in the work area.  Take the label that says “water” and say, as placing the placing it in front of the bottle, “This says “water” so, I am placing it here in front of our water specimen. 
7. Take the last bottle and announce that you now have to get an air specimen. Ask the children where the air is on the globe. Ask them where the air is here. “Yes, it is all around us.” Here is how I am going to get an air specimen.” Take the bottle or container and swiftly and with emphasis make swopping action as if to scoop up some air and then quickly put the top on it. Alternatively, you can also ask the children to focus on their breathing and guide them to realize that air is all around us and the container already has air in it. Put the top on and place it in a prominent place in the work area.  Take the label that says “air” and say, as placing the placing it in front of the bottle, “This says “air” so, I am placing it here in front of our air specimen. 
8. To include fire as the fourth element, see Presentation II
9. Conclude the lesson by reviewing the three elements and naming them or asking for student to identify various specimens. Thank the children for coming to lesson. 



**Presentation II:**  FIRE AS THE FOURTH ELEMENT

1. Tell the children that there is one more element of Earth that we do not see as much or as often as land, air and water but it is there in and on Earth.  
2. Take a candle and a lighter out. Tell the children that within the center of the Earth and in volcanoes and during some earthquakes there is hot, molten rock and fire ignites. Using the globe, you can explain that some of the land on Earth is made from these volcanic explosions and earthquakes. Small tiny pieces of land, like these islands, pointing to a place on the Land and Water globe are formed. Also, fires naturally burn on the land and help renew the land. The ashes help new plants grow. Tell the children that this candle represents element of fire that we find on Earth too. 
3. Place the candle in the run and light it. 
4. Then write the label “ fire” and place it in front of the candle.
**NOTE:** If you want to have a shelf work that has the four elements, you can use a small battery-operated candle on the work. Or, you can place a real candle and have the children come and ask for a light. This way you will be able to observe for safety reasons. 

**Points of Interest:**
- Learning outdoors 
- Getting specimens 
- Filling the air bottle
- real life context of the three elements

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher
- Land and Water globe
- Peers

**Variations:**
- Using more concrete items to suggest air: balloon, ribbon on a stick, falling leaves
- Using a stream or natural water source to get the water
- Using various types of soil in one jar, sandy soil, organic matter, humus. 
- Have children bring in specimens from their gardens, beach, etc
- Write the labels in front of the child after putting the top on the bottle/container.

**Extensions:**
- Experiment with different “land”/ soils: clay; loam, sand, compost for plant growth
- Do experiment with water and air (air bubbles, pockets within water; ice; other liquids)

**Vocabulary:**
Land and its variants: soil, dirt, humus, compost etc.; water and its variants: streams, lake, oceans, salt water; air and its variants: atmosphere, sky, breathing, oxygen

- Lesson(s) on the Land and Water globe 
- Lesson on Earth’s Elements 
- Discussions that the Earth is made of different parts 
- Zoology: Living and non-living lesson or other basic sorting games/exercises (or, if this has not been presented yet, consider only using objects of living things initially)
- Lessons on Grace and Courtesy for rolling and respecting materials 

**Materials:** 
- Land, water and air mat 
- Several objects for each part of the mat (living and non-living for land, water and air) 
- Labels for “air”, “water”, “land” (May have visual cues for non-readers)

**Indirect Aims:** 
- Practice with concrete objects the three basic components of the Earth’s composition
- Learn about the living and non-living things found in these three areas
- Introduce the divergent thinking: the idea that some living and non-living things can be in more than one category (a plane can be on land or in the air and a frog can be in the water or on land etc.)  

**Direct Aims:** 
- To sort living and non-living objects according to the Earth’s components 
- To learn about habitats of various living things
- Practice the concepts of Earth’s Elements

**Indirect Aims:** 
- To prepare for distinguishing land and water forms
- To prepare for Zoology and Botany works of sorting and classifying 

**Age:** 3-5

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**

**Sensorial Level:** (Level of Knowledge) seeing and touching the different fabrics and textures of the mat; identifying the colors; match colors of mats to parts of Earth: land, water, air.

**Naming/Concept Level:** (Level of Application) Produce the animals, insects, birds in the various areas of Land, Water and Air. Explore other names of land such as mountain, beach, field etc. of water such as lake, ocean, stream; of air such as, sky and atmosphere; draw/illustrate new animals on paper to go in various places on the mat.

**Higher Order Thinking Level:** (Level of Evaluation): relate or justify why the animals are in various places on the mat; classify new animals; compare and support why there are two locations for one animal 

**Presentation:**
1. Invite a small group of children to a rug. Thank the children for coming. Go and get the Land, Air and Water mat work showing the children where it is kept on the shelf. 
2. Announce the name of the Lesson and the name of the work. 
3. Remove the mat from the tray or basket and unroll it on the rug.  
4. Remove the basket of items and place in the lower right corner of the rug. 
5. Tell the children there are three elements of Earth: land, water and air. Point as you say the names. Remove the air label and hold it in your hand. Say “This says, “air” and I am going to place it here (on the air portion of the mat). Do the same for the labels for “land” and “water”.  
6. Point to the basket and tell them that we will be sorting the objects according to whether they live or are found on land, in water or in the air. Remove the first object. Select an object that lives exclusively in that area, for example, a fish in water. Ask, “In which of the three areas that make up Earth does a fish live?” After they respond, “water”, place the fish in the water. Do the same for a land animal. Then choose a bird or plane and ask, “In which area is a bird found?” This will likely spark some discussion as birds also do live on land too. Explain this interesting point: that a living animal or a thing can belong to two areas. Repeat with a plane. Point out the dual category again.  
7. Invite the child/children to continue the exercise.  
8. You may need to show then students how to roll up the mat and secure it closed, if needed or how to fit all the parts of the work back on the tray/ in the basket so they fit neatly and securely.  
9. Thank the children for coming to lesson. Remind them to put it away in a manner that is ready for the next person or group and where it belongs on the shelf. 
 
**Language/ Vocabulary:**\
land, air, water (can include variations such as atmosphere, ocean, mountains, marshland etc.); name of each object in the basket 

**Points of Interest:** 
- Small objects 
- The textures of the mat
- Assembly of the mat (if that is part of the work)
- Objects that belong to two or more categories 

**Control of Error:** 
- Design cues: none specifically. The control of error is in the eye of the child 
- Points of emphasis: the union of two elements on the mat for example, where land meets water. 

**Variations:**
- Add new objects
- Incorporate other objects from around the classroom

**Extensions:** 
- Invite the child to illustrate some more animals or objects
- Write sentences about what they see on the mat. Such as “a bird lives in the air”, “a fish is in the water”, “a bug lives on land” 
- Draw a picture of land, water and air and draw new living and non-living items in each area. 

**Notes:** 
Try to have objects that are as proportionately sized as possible. For example, avoid having a clown fish that is as big as a plane.

{{< figure class="float-right white-outline preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image007.webp" caption="Shelf version of the presentation material" >}}

- A large ball of black yarn or black ribbon (it is helpful to precut the yarn/ribbon and label each piece for each planet. The yarn is to represent the planet’s orbit. You may choose to make the yarn/ribbon orbits go all the way around the “sun” (large ball) or just a section of the orbit to show the impression of an orbit.]
- The frame of the ellipse metal inset ( optional)
- Labels for sun, orbit, all planets, asteroid belt, solar system or paper and pencil to write the labels as you announce them
- Rough and varied rocks (to represent the asteroid belt)

**Direct Aims:**
- Give the children an idea of the breadth of the universe
- Give them an idea of the size of the sun
- Demonstrate the order of the planets
- Present a “big-picture view” of the solar system
- Grasp the size of the sun

**Indirect Aims:**
- Ignite interest in the universe, the solar system
- Prepare for great lessons in Elementary 
- Prepare for “big-work”
- Prepare for lessons on the Milky way, on the Birthday celebration, time, seasons etc.

**Age:** 3-6

**Presentation:** This is a group lesson that has a corresponding shelf work that the children can do individually.
1. Gather the children in a large open space. This can be in a hallway, outdoors or in a large room
2. Begin by recounting recent discussions of space found in readings and books. Show them a flag of the Earth. Pause here and admire the beauty of our Earth, our home. Explain that the only way to take this picture is to be in space. Consider sharing quotes from astronauts:

{{< grid-table class="col-2" >}}

{{< div >}}
“It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth.
I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.
I didn’t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.”\
– Neil Armstrong, Astronaut,\
First Human to Walk on the Moon
{{< /div >}}

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/culture/geo/image009.webp" >}}

{{< div >}}
“As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally, it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.”\
– James B. Irwin,\
Astronaut, Apollo Program
{{< /div >}}

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/culture/geo/image011.webp" >}}

{{< /grid-table >}}


3. Fold up the flag and put it aside. Tell them when we are in space, we can see the neighbors of the Earth, such as other planets and the moon. In fact, we can see many beautiful objects that you are going to hear about now.
4. Tell them the first thing we see is the light from sun. Go get the large yellow ball which should be hidden until now and place it in the center of the large space. Tell them that this represents the sun. The sun is so big that over 1 million (1.3) Earths could fit inside it. 
5. Read the label “sun”, or write it in front of them and place it next to the sun. 
6. Tell the children that from the Earth we can see and feel the sun, but we are far really very far away. Tell them there are other planets that are closer to the sun.

7. Tell them the planet that is closest to the sun is Mercury. It is very hot, no human or space craft has ever traveled to Mercury too hot. There is no life and do not yet know how to even travel there since it is so very hot. Place or write the label, Mercury. Explain that Mercury travels around the sun in an ellipse, called an orbit. Bring out the metal inset frame of an ellipse. Tell the children that this is the shape of an orbit. Place the black yarn/ribbon to make an ellipse shape. Inviting children to help place the orbit may be helpful and engaging. 
8. Continue with each planet, giving simple but accurate scientific facts of each planet. Place the black yarn/ribbon to make an ellipse shape. Inviting children to help place the orbit may be helpful and engaging. When you get to Earth, emphasize that planet Earth is not too close and not too far away. In fact, earth is just right. This makes our planet very special and different from all the other planets. Scientists do not even really understand or have a reason as to why our planet is so special.
9. Continue until you get to Mars. Tell the children that now scientists have discovered that there is a special ring of rocks, called the Asteroid Belt that spins and moves but surrounds all the planets we have seen so far. The planets inside the belt, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are called the “Rocky planets.” Place the rocks around to form the asteroid belt.  
10.  Continue to explain that the planets that come after the belt of rocks, further away from the sun are called the “Gaseous planets”. The first one is Jupiter. Provide a few facts about this gaseous planet and place the label. Place the black yarn/ribbon to make an ellipse shape.  Inviting children to help place the orbit may be helpful and engaging.
11. When you get to the last planet, tell the children that this entire set of planets and the sun is called the “Solar System.:  “Solar” means sun and “system” means “a set of connected parts that form a complex whole”.  Our solar system has a sun and its parts that make it a complex whole are the planets, the asteroids and moons. 
12. When all is set up and labeled, take time to admire the model of the Solar System. Ask questions or answer their questions about the Solar System.
13. Tell the students that this was a demonstration work, but that there is a work on the shelf that has the planets, a long piece of black cloth and the labels for the planets.
14. Demonstrate this work to the children, relating each piece to the large model that was used for presentation purposes.

**Points of Interest:**
- Very large sun
- Very large numbers given in this lesson
- Very large layout of this lesson
- Images of Earth from space

**Control of Error:**
- Design cues: size of sun, sizes of planet models, real pictures of the celestial objects
- Teacher

**Variations:** 
- A shelf version of this work that has a long black mat (a black table runner works well) or a long piece of black felt, models of the planets and the labels, and a battery-operated candle for the sun. You can include the orbit yarn as part of the shelf work, or not. Also, the stars are optional.

**Extensions:**
- Do a slide presentation with real images of the planets, the sun and asteroids. 
- Make paper-maché planets
- Introduce the moons around the planets, including Earth’s one moon
- Sing songs and jingles to learn the order of the planets
- Create the Solar System with the students outside having one be the sun, one each planet, some asteroids, moons etc.  Have the students “orbit” around the sun.

**Language/ Vocabulary:**
- Universe, Galaxy, Solar system, millions, asteroid belt, names of planets, orbit

**NOTE:** When doing the demonstration, it is fun to include stars (wooden stars pray painted silver work well). Confetti or sparkles make for hard clean up and likely detract from the lesson too much. However, if you use stars in the demonstration, which is fun for the children, be sure to tell the children that we only have one star in our Solar system, our sun. &ldquo;The sun looks a lot bigger than a star in the sky because it is a lot closer to us than the stars. All the stars that you see in the sky are NOT in our Solar system but ARE in our Milky Way Galaxy.&rdquo;

**Age:** 4 - 5

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image015.webp" alt="" >}}

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**
- Sensorial Level:
- Naming/Concept Level:
- Higher Order Thinking Level:

**Presentation I:** OUR MILKY WAY GALAXY AND OTHER GALAXIES

1. Invite the child to the presentation.  Thank the child for coming to lesson.
2. Keeping the other cards hidden or turned over, only show the child the picture of Earth from space. Converse about previous lessons about Earth in space.

3. Show the child the picture of the Solar system. Find Earth in the line of planets.
4. Tell the child that our Solar system belongs to an even bigger system. Our Solar system is just one system in a galaxy.  Our Solar system has one star, the sun. The stars we see are not in our Solar System, but they are in our galaxy. Our solar system, the sun and planets are all nestled in a larger system, called the Milky Way galaxy. So, when we see the stars we are looking at our galaxy, beyond our Solar system.

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image017.webp" >}}

[Scientists have found other systems but none, so far that has a planet similar to Earth.  There are over 300 billion stars in the Milky way. The Universe is all of space and time and all its objects, which includes over 100 billion galaxies.] 
5. Present to the child a picture of the Milky Way Galaxy. Point to the billions of stars. Explain that a galaxy is made of dust, stars and gases and it is held together by gravity and because it spins. 

6. Show the child a picture of the Milky Way Galaxy as seen from space. 

Pause with the child about how amazing and huge is our galaxy. 

The center of the galaxy is called the Galactic Center and is a supermassive black hole.

{{< figure class="white-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image019.webp" caption="Milky Way photo that shows our star, our Sun" >}}

Planets outside our Solar system are called “exoplanets”. Scientists have found thousands in the past 20 years. 

7. Examine the photo of the galaxy. Point to the spiraling pattern. Tell the child that the Milky way is a spiral galaxy. [Most spiral galaxies consist of a flat, rotating disk containing stars, gas and dust, and a central concentration of stars known as the bulge.]

8. Take a piece of black paper and tell the child you are going to draw a spiral galaxy as if we are looking down on it. Choose a white pencil or glitter glue pen and begin to draw a spiral galaxy. If a special writing implement is used, show the child how to use the pen, marker, glue pen etc. Take the image of the Milky Way Galaxy that indicates where our sun is (above photo) and locate the Sun. Find the area on the drawing where the Sun would be and, using a gold pen/glue pen make a small gold dot for the Sun. Invite the child to make their own spiral galaxy and indicate where to put it to dry.  

9. Thank the child for coming to lesson.

**Presentation II:** OTHER TYPES OF GALAXIES

1. Invite the child to the lesson. Show the card of the pictures of a spiral galaxy. (This can include the Milky Way and other spiral [Pinwheel] galaxies. Then, take out pictures of other real galaxies that are elliptical and irregular. After you name the galaxy placing it in the work area, write or place a label underneath the picture. Do a three-period lesson on the three types of galaxies now laid out in front of the child. 
2. Take the black paper and do the same as the previous lesson for the spiral galaxy; drawing in front of the child what they see. Label the drawing according to the type of galaxy drawn.

{{< grid-table class="col-3" >}}

{{< figure class="white-outline pure-img" src="/img/culture/geo/image025.webp" caption="Irregular galaxy" >}}

{{< /grid-table >}}


**Points of Interest:**
- the enormity of the Milky Way galaxy
- the types of galaxies and their shapes
- the use of the new pens/glitter glue pens/gold and silver writing implements
- the use of black paper as the background
- the comparative smallness of our Solar System within the Milky Way galaxy
- the sense of awe and admiration the teacher demonstrates during the lesson

**Control of Error:**
- the real photos take in space from Hubble telescope or other means
- the teacher

**Variations:**
- Using different paper and different writing implements

**Extensions:**
- Making a three-dimensional model of a galaxy with silver, fuzzy pipe cleaners wound together in a spiral

#### OUR COSMIC ADDRESS

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image027.webp" caption="Waseca nesting boxes https://wasecabiomes.org/products/cosmic-nesting-boxes" >}}

**Materials:**
- Waseca Cosmic Nesting Boxes *
- Handmade nesting boxes or envelopes 
(Typically, there are 10 in the sequence- see NOTES at end of lesson)
* When ordering this material, one can identify the state, city and school so the nesting boxes will reflect your actual cosmic address.

**Prerequisites:** 
- Lessons from Our Earth: Our Home
- Solar system
- Milky Way galaxy lesson
- Continent globe (optional)
- North America Map (optional) 
- US Map (optional) 

**Direct Aims:**
- Use a concrete model to represent one’s location on Earth as it is compared to Earth’s place in the universe
- Represent the entirety of the universe and out place in it

**Indirect Aim:**
- Preparation of elementary work of Cosmic education
- Preparation of map work (if they have not done mapping work yet)
- Preparation of more physical science works and experiments as well as other lessons in Cultural studies such as biomes, continent and country study

**Age:** 3 - 5 

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**
* Sensorial Level:
* Naming/Concept Level:
* Higher Order Thinking Level:

**Presentation I:** OUR COSMIC ADDRESS

1. Tell the children that we are going to learn our cosmic address. Ask, “Where do we actually live besides just in outside of our city/town of ___________. 
2. Bring the Waseca Nesting boxes to the rug. They should be all nested one in another, right side up and out of sight.
Begin with the largest box: The Universe. Say: “We live in the Universe.” 
Place the largest box in the center of the rug.
3. Holding the next box, say: “Within the Universe, is the Milky Way Galaxy. We live in the Universe, and within the Universe we live in the Milky Way.”  Place the Milky Way box on top of the Universe box. 
4. Holding the next box, say: “One of the Solar Systems in the Milky way is our Solar System. We live in the Universe, within the Milky Way, within the Solar System. You can point to each box as you reiterate each part of the “cosmic address”.  Place the Solar system box on top of the Milky Way box. 
5. Holding the next box, say: “One of the planets within the Solar system is Earth. We live on Earth, which is the third planet in the Solar system, which is found in the Milky way, which is found in the Universe. You can point to each box as you reiterate each part of the “cosmic address”.  Place the box for Earth on next. 
6. Take the box for North America.  Holding the next box, say, “We are located in (or, on the continent of) North America, which is found on Earth, which is found in the Solar system, which is found in the Milky Way, which is in the Universe. You can point to each box as you reiterate each part of the “cosmic address”. 
7. Continue through, country, state, city, school, each time pointing the box as you reiterate each part of the “cosmic address”.
8. Holding the final box, say: “Here we are. You can tell the children that the image on the box that represents us as humans is a symbol for “energy”. That is because every human person, and everyone in this school, has energy in them. And, it is some of the same energy that we find in the stars in the galaxies that are in all throughout the Universe.  We are all connected to each other and to the Universe.
9. Tell the children now we know our cosmic address. Start at the top and proceed to the bottom saying: I am here with my energy and  I am in school, in the city of ***, in the state of **** , in the country of the United States, on the continent of North America, on the planet Earth, in the Solar system and in the Milky Way Galaxy. 

**Notes:**\
*The ten layers are:*\
Milky Way galaxy\
Solar system\
Earth\
North America\
United States\
State\
City\
School\
Child\
Energy

10. Invite the children to carefully view the pictures of the tower as they take it down.  Show them how to nest the boxes starting with the largest. Show them that the Universe ‘holds all the other parts.’ Remind them again, that the smallest box is connected to the largest by the same “energy”.
11. Consider reading the book You Are Stardust by Elin Kelsey
12. Thank the child for coming to lesson. 

**Points of Interest:**
- The ten cubes reminiscent of the Pink Tower 
- The repetition of the places in the address
- The magnitude of our cosmic address

**Control of Error:**
- The design features of the work
- The child
- The teacher

**Variations:**
- Use fewer envelopes or boxes (perhaps 5 only) 

**Extensions:**
- Making a work with envelopes that nest
- Making a booklet of the tower of our Cosmic address

**Vocabulary:**
Universe, Milky Way galaxy, Solar system, Earth, North America, United States, State, City, School, energy (or child), cosmic address, billions

### EARTH AND SUN: ORBIT & TILT (can connect with Botany/ Seasons & History/ Time - Birthday celebration){.redc}

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image029.webp" caption="Earth spins counterclockwise on its axis and counterclockwise around the sun." >}}

**Prerequisites:**
- Solar System lesson and discussions/ reading 
- Birthday celebration (optional)
- Mapping lessons including transition from sphere to hemispheres
- Shelf work version of this work: small black mat; small flashlight; image of arrow going counter clockwise.

**Materials:**
- Large black cloth (can use same as the Solar System demonstration)	
- Land and Water globe or Painted globe with stand (best to have a globe with a metal axis pole going all through the sphere and with the sphere being removable)
- Traditional globe (larger than a Montessori globe)
- Hemisphere circle (as used in mapping lessons)
- Holder for the flashlight and a large, powerful flashlight. (A large vs. a small flashlight really makes a difference in this demonstration) 
- Long black ribbon/yarn to demonstrate the ellipse of Earth’s orbit
- Adhesive colored dots
**Direct Aims:**
- Demonstrate Earth’s turning counter clock ways in one day and circling the sun in one year. 
- Demonstrate the side of Earth facing the Sun.
- Demonstrate the constant tilt of Earth (toward the Sun) and the ellipse that it makes when doing a revolution
**Indirect Aims:**
- Functions as a precursor lesson for the birthday celebration; lessons on time and biome work

**Age:** 3-6

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**
* Sensorial Level:
* Naming/Concept Level:
* Higher Order Thinking Level:

**Presentation I:** EARTH AND SUN: DAY AND NIGHT - ROTATION

1. This can be done as a whole group presentation. Invite the group to a large open space. Consider dimming the lights and/or closing the blinds or curtains. Thank the children for coming to this demonstration.
2. Ask a child to bring the Painted or Land and Water globe to the demonstration area.  Bring out the traditional globe. Initiate parallels between the two globes. Point out the differences among the two globes. Tell the children for this demonstration, you are going to use the larger globe. Set the Montessori globe aside.
3. Take out the flashlight holder. Ask the children where the sun is located in our Solar system. Recall the other presentation with all the planets when the large ball was in the center. Show the children the flashlight, shine it on the ceiling and tell them that this represents the sun’s rays in this demonstration. Place the cylindrical holder in the center of the black cloth with the flashlight turned off. [It will be helpful to test this beforehand to fine the best location for the globe (closer or farther away) on the black cloth so as to obtain the best possible illumination of on the globe’s surface.]
4.  Ask the children to look at the large globe. Then, pause for a second and turn on the flashlight. Show the part of the globe that is lit up by pointing to the perimeter of the shining light. Tell the children this is the sun touching Earth’s surface. Ask the children when we see the sun. Elicit conversations about day and night. Take an adhesive dot and place it in the middle of where the light is shining. Tell them this is a mark to show where day is on Earth. Point to the other side that is unlit and tell them that this is where night is happening. 
5. Take out the card that show the symbol for counterclockwise. Place it right next to the base of the globe. Either invite a child or turn the globe in the same counterclockwise direction, demonstrating following the symbol as you turn. Slowly turn the globe, pointing out that the dot is moving out of the sun’s rays. Turn the globe all the way until the dot is in the opposite place from its starting point. Tell the children that now, this is part of the globe that was in the middle of day is now in the middle of night. 
6. Continue variations of turning the globe to demonstrate day and night. You can explain that when the sun looks like it is setting, it is really Earth turning away from the sun and another part of Earth will be lit up. Tell them there is always some part of the earth that is facing the sun because the sun does not move, Earth moves. You can tell them that the Earth is moving slowly and at constant speed so we do not feel that it si moving, but it actually is!  
7. Tell the children that when Earths turns or spins, we call that a rotation. Earth makes a full rotation in one day. As you spin the globe, narrate a day’s schedule to the children: The sunlight starts to shine here, this is the morning when we say the sun “rises” ( you can say “but we know that the sun doesn’t really rise!”), then we see more sunlight during the day, throughout the day and then the sun goes away and night starts. Then we are in bed and asleep and Earth turns the rest of the way while we are sleeping. That is one whole rotation that is both day and night.  
8. Invite the children to share thoughts about day and night, their experiences of seeing the sun “ rise” and “ set”. 
9. Show the children the work that is on the shelf for them to do to practice rotation. It has a small flashlight, some stickers and the counterclockwise symbol. You may want to put a picture of the Montessori globe on the tray/ basket, so they know to go and get the globe for the work. There is not a separate write up for this. The children use the flashlight to shine on the globe, place a sticker and turn the globe counterclockwise and watch the sticker move away from the sun. 

**Presentation II:** EARTH AND SUN: ONE YEAR – REVOLUTION 

1. Invite the children to lesson. Thank them for coming. This can be a large or small group lesson. It is good for third years as an afternoon lesson. 
2. Set up the black mat, the traditional globe and the flashlight (turned off) in the holder. 
3. Review day and night and counterclockwise rotations.
4. Remind the children that Earth travels in an orbit, an ellipse around the sun. 
5. Invite a few children to take the black yarn/ribbon and make an ellipse on the cloth with the piece of yarn, recalling the orbit from the Solar system presentation and the metal inset frame. Help the children if needed.
6. Place the globe on the orbit at one of the far ends of the ellipse.
7. Point out that Earth is not straight up (tilt the globe to show this) but rather, tilted. If you have a Montessori globe that can be removed from the stand with the metal axis pols, this is helpful to show them the tilt. 
8. Turn on the flashlight. As you rotate the globe, point out the area tilted toward the sun. 
9. Remind the children that earth rotates AND makes a turn around the sun. Slowly carry the large globe one quarter turn around the sun, going counterclockwise again. Place the globe at this midpoint on the ellipse/orbit. Turn the flashlight to shine on the globe in the new position. Spin the globe counterclockwise to show where the TILTED part of Earth is. Explain that the seasons are caused by this tilt: when it is summer, the warm weather happens because that part of the TILTED Earth is closer to the sun, likewise, in winter, when the TILT is away from the sun, it is colder. [The seasons are not the result of the place in the ellipse - though this seems the case – it is the TILT of Earth that causes the seasons.]
10. Continue to carry the globe another quarter turn around the ellipse/ orbit. Continue to rotate the globe making day and night as it moves around the sun. Stop at half way around from the initial start point. Keep highlighting the TILT as the most important part of the journey around the sun. You can include ant of the following types of language: “This whole journey is called a “revolution” and its takes one year. …That is why we have one summer, one fall, one winter and one spring; all in one year around the sun… It is also why you only have one birthday a year. It takes a whole year for the earth to go around the sun. One revolution is one year. “

**Points of Interest:**
- Flashlight and large globe
- Demonstration lesson
- Small group lesson for older children
- the tilt of the earth

**Control of Error:**
- Design cues of the globe
- Teacher

**Variations:**
- Connect to a birthday celebration

**Extensions:**
- Draw the earth’s tilt and the sun in various places in its orbit to make seasons

**Vocabulary:**
revolution, year, axis, tilt, season, ellipse, orbit, winter, spring, summer, fall

### PARTS OF THE EARTH: NOMENCLATURE{.redc}

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image033.webp" caption="Learning Resources Geometric Solids: This set could be used for many activities in Culture as well as other areas of the classroom." >}}

**Materials:**
Painted globe or Land and Water globe
Masking tape (red or cream work well) 
Labels for equator, North Pole, South Pole
Geometric solid of a half sphere  

**Prerequisites:** 
- Lessons from Our Earth: Physical Sciences 
- Cardinal Points (optional) 

**Direct Aims:**
- learn the names of the parts of Earth
- identify the names on a model of Earth

**Indirect Aim:**  
- Prepare for mapping works, work with puzzle maps
**Age:** 4 - 5 

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**
* Sensorial Level:
* Naming/Concept Level:
* Higher Order Thinking Level:

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the presentation.  Thank the child for coming to lesson.
2. Bring the Painted Globe (or other globe) to the rug and a roll of masking tape.
3. Place the globe in the center of the rug. Remind the child of recent and previous lessons or discussions related to the globe and Earth. Slowly and carefully take the globe off the metal axis pole attached to the wooden base. Move the base to the side.
4. Point out that the metal pole is angled. Tell the students that the globe is this way because it is an accurate model of real Earth.  Tell the students that there is an “imaginary pole” that goes through the Earth and it is called the axis. Tell them that the Earth spins on its axis and that the Earth is “tilted” to one side and never changes. Earth spins in a tilted manner on its axis. 
5. Tell the students that there are names for the top and bottom of this imaginary pole that goes through the Earth. At the top of the globe, there is the North Pole and at the bottom of the globe, the South pole. Tell them they are called poles because it is like a pole that goes through the Earth and that that the pole is tilted. Review: the imaginary “pole” is called the axis; the end of the axis at the top of the Earth is the North Pole and the end on the bottom of the Earth is the South Pole. 
6. Invite the children to point to the widest part of the globe. Tell the children that we are going to talk about this widest part of the Earth’s surface. Take the roll of masking tape and adhere it to a point on the equator and then, continue to wrap a piece of masking tape all the way around the globe sphere where the equator lies, making a full circle. Point out that the tape covers both land and water in different places on Earth.
7. Run your two fingers around the center of the sphere saying that “this is an ‘imaginary line’ around the earth called, the equator. It is an imaginary line that splits the earth exactly in half.” [Having a wooden half sphere (or two) is very useful for this presentation]. You can tell them then “equa” means “equal” and the two parts of the earth are equal, making a whole sphere.
8. Take the labels and do a three-period lesson with the labels for the three parts of the globe.

**Points of Interest:**
- taking the globe off the stand
- the top and both of the earth – North and South poles
- the “imaginary” line
- taping the globe
- placing the label “on” Earth since it won’t stay unless adhered. 

**Control of Error:**
- teacher 
- geometric solids 
- Accuracy of the material / model (globe and stand)

**Variations:**
- Using the large traditional globe previous lessons
- Showing the plastic “seam” on the globe instead of adhering tape
- Using a ribbon or other flexible material to indicate the equator.

**Extensions:**
- making a booklet of the parts of the globe (similar to Botany/ Zoology works with only the one name/ part colored in red 
- show the child 2-dimensional view of the earth from the poles; a view from the North and South poles. This also teaches them about the size and shape of Antarctica and the Polar ice cap.
- Works related to Antarctica: continent size, shape, animals, waters, sustainability, island land form and the only place on Earth whose land is dedicated to “peaceful purposes only” [“Antarctica shall be used for peaceful purposes only” (Article I of The Antarctic Treaty that was signed in 1959 by the 12 countries)].
- Ice formations etc. 
**Vocabulary:**
- North pole, South pole, equator, Antarctica, half sphere.

**Presentation II:** The Climate Zones of the Earth

**Materials:**
Painted globe, Land and Water globe or a traditional globe 
that has the zones painted on it
Labels for the zones: polar regions, temperate regions 
and the torrid zones
Red, blue and green masking tape

**Lesson:**
1. Invite the children to the rug. Thank them for coming to lesson.
2. Announce the name of the lesson
3. Place the (Montessori) Painted globe or a traditional globe that is painted with the colors of the zones on a low table or rug.
4. If using the Montessori globe, ask the children to show you the widest part of Earth. 
5. Using the RED masking tape, tape around the equator. Name this area part of Earth. Then continue to put a band of red tape above and again, below the equator. Once you have a wide red band around the middle of Earth, name this area: This is tropical zone of Earth. It is the warmest part of the Earth. But, it is not warm all the time, it’s just that it never gets as cold as other parts of Earth. It is the closest to the sun’s rays. 
6. Next, take the green masking tape. Wrap in front of the children 2-3 bands above the tropical zone and again, two or three bands below the tropical zone. As you wrap, you can share facts about each zone.  the tropical and the temperate zones.\
Temperate: https://study.com/academy/lesson/temperate-climate-zone-lesson-for-kids-definition-facts.html 

7. Finally, take the blue tape and wrap the polar zones at the North and South poles. Narrate about the polar zones and compare them to the other zones.

8. If using a traditional globe painted with the three climate zones, use this globe for the lesson and do not use the tape.
9. Bring out Labels of each zone. Do a three-period lesson about the climate zones of Earth. 
10. Thank the children for coming to lesson.

### EARTH: THREE STATES OF MATTER: A SPECIAL PLANET{.redc}

**Prerequisites:**
- Land/air/water mat lesson
- Three (or four[fire]) elements of the Earth lesson
- Talking and reading about volcanoes, molten rock, hot lava etc.

**Materials:**
- Three clear glass identical containers (one with frozen water, one with liquid water and one that is “empty” / filled with air.
- Other samples of solid: a piece of wood, a rock, a leaf, an apple; 
- Other examples of other liquids: milk, honey, coffee, orange juice, rubbing alcohol
- Other examples of gas: a helium balloon, perfume spray, air freshener (this helps the children understand that the gas is dispersed in the air and we cannot see it, but we can feel, smell or taste it, thus it is present.
- Labels for each state
- Picture of heat (fire, red hot burner, etc.)
- Picture of cold (ice, freezer, 
- Thermometer (optional)
- A cup of tea that is steaming (the steam is visibly rising up)
- Picture (or book) molten rock, lava or a volcano that is erupting and flowing

**Direct Aims:**
- Make the children aware of their natural surroundings and raise awareness of the three states of matter.

**Indirect Aims:**
- Raise awareness that Earth is the only known planet that has these three states of matter.  (There is a fourth state, plasma, but this does not exist on Earth, but in stars).  
- Teach how to identify and categorize the states of matter

**Age:** 4-6

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**
* Sensorial Level:
* Naming/Concept Level:
* Higher Order Thinking Level:

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to a rug or invite a group to a gathering time. Thank them for coming to lesson. 
2. Bring all three clear glass containers to the rug on a tray
3. Tell the children the name of the lesson: Three States of Matter
4. Ask the children to look and observe the three containers without talking 
5. Ask their children what they think are in each glass container
6. Begin asking questions and seeking answers to get to the deduction that the first two dishes, ice and water are related. Talk about how they are different and how they could change from one to the other. 
7. Tell the children that we call this a “state” of water: liquid water is the water we drink; the solid state of water is known as “ice”. 
8. Place the label “solid” next to/ in front of the ice, and “liquid” next to/ in front of the water. 
9. At this point, you could proceed to “gas” but it is suggested to keep with the first two states, solid and liquid and give more examples.
10. Pour a glass of orange juice. Ask the students where you should put this glass of orange juice, in the solid column or liquid column. Continue with other liquids and solids, such as milk, an apple, a nail, a cup coffee/ tea etc.
11. Use the Three Period Lesson to assure understanding of the first two states.
12. Take the third “empty” glass container and tell them you are now going to teach them the third state of matter.
13. Tell them that this container has air (oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide) in it. Even though we cannot see it, it is there. Gases are invisible. Place the label next to/ in front of the gas filled glass container.
14. Proceed to take out other examples of gases (see list above under Materials). Place them near or in the column of “gas”.
15. Help them understand that even water, can be a gas, and that is steam or vapor.
16. Bring the steaming cup of tea to the rug. Point out the steam and show them that this is water in the state of gas going into the air. 
17. Review the three states of matter with them.

**Presentation II:**
1. Remind the children of the similarities between the water and the ice. Facilitate a discussion about the role of temperature.
2. Tell the children that the temperature determines the state of matter for all matter.
3. Remind them of the stories/ reading about volcanoes. Facilitate the discussion to explain that lava is molten rock; rock that is so hot that it is no longer a solid. Compare a picture of hot lava to a real rock.

4. Discuss that heat or cold will make matter change states. Ask questions about changing the state of various liquids, solids and gases to ensure comprehension.
5. Show pictures of heat and cold. Place the pictures in the various columns to show that heat or cold can make matter change from any of the states to another state. Begin with having them see that by adding heat to ice, water changes to liquid state. By adding further heat, the water will boil and then turn to steam. 

**Language/ Vocabulary:**\
matter, states of matter; solid, liquid, gas, temperature, molten rock; lava

**Points of Interest:**
* The various solids, liquids and gases (helium balloon, ice, orange juice)
* The role of the imagination and their experiences with states of matter
* A science experiment and with everyday objects/ gases and liquids

**Control of Error:**
- Design cues: the three identical glass containers
- Points of emphasis: heat and cold, temperature

**Variations and Extensions:**
- Use a different liquid and solid (milk and ice cream) 
- Use a burner and a frying pan to melt ice to water and then, to steam until there is nothing left in the pan. This is the best way to give this lesson but health and safety codes may not allow it. It is so effective because by the end of the lesson, there is “nothing” left; all the solid water (ice) is in the form of gas in the air.

**Notes:**\
**Examples of Solids**\
Solids are a form of matter that has a definite shape and volume.

1. gold
2. wood
3. sand
4. steel
5. brick
6. rock
7. copper
8. brass
9. apple
10. aluminum foil

11. ice
12. butter

**Examples of Liquids**\
Liquids are a form of matter that has a definite volume but no defined shape. Liquids can flow and assume the shape of their container.
1. water
2. milk
3. blood
4. urine
5. gasoline
6. mercury (an element)
7. bromine (an element)
8. wine
9. rubbing alcohol
10. honey
11. coffee

**Examples of Gases**\
A gas is a form of matter that does not have a defined shape or volume. Gases expand to fill the space they are given.
1. air
2. helium
3. nitrogen
4. Freon
5. carbon dioxide
6. water vapor
7. hydrogen
8. natural gas
9. propane
10. oxygen
11. ozone
12. hydrogen sulfide

**Phase (State) Changes**\
Depending on the temperature and pressure, the matter may transition from one state into another:
* solids may melt into liquids
* solids may sublimate into gases (sublimation)
* liquids may vaporize into gases
* liquids may freeze into solids
* gases may condense into liquids
* gases may deposit into solids (deposition)

Increasing pressure and decreasing temperature forces the atoms and molecules closer to each other so their arrangement becomes more ordered. Gases become liquids; liquids become solids. On the other hand, increasing temperature and decreasing pressure allows particles to move further apart. Solids become liquids; liquids become gases. Depending on the conditions, a substance may skip a phase, so a solid may become a gas or a gas may become a solid without experiencing the liquid phase.

### EARTH: A SPECIAL MAGNET{.redc}

#### MAGNETISM

**Prerequisites:**
- Lessons (from the Sensorial or early Language area) that require the students to use a label at the top of the rug and to sort or categorize the materials by placing them in a vertical column under the label. For example, “sound, no sound” or “small, medium, large” lessons from the Sensorial area.

**Materials:**
- common magnetic items that are a safe size for 3-6-year-olds
- common non-magnetic items that are a safe size for 3-6 -year-olds
- a magnetic bar or wand
- labels for “magnetic” & “nonmagnetic”

**Direct Aims:**
- using magnets in our everyday life 
- sort magnetic and nonmagnetic objects
- familiarize themselves with typical magnet objects

**Indirect Aims:**
- Teach the students about the naturally occurring property of magnetism
- Prepare for further studies on Earth’s magnetic fields

**Ages:** 3-5

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the child to the rug.
2. Remind the child that Earth is a very special planet, such as the three states of matter: liquids, solids and gases. 
3. There is another part of Earth that is very special: the special feature is at the very center of the sphere in what we call, the core. Earth has very hot molten rocks there and these rocks have a special power, called magnetism. These rocks have certain metals in them that are magnetic. 
4. Magnetic means that they attract certain other metals. 
5. Bring basket of items to the work space: the collection of objects, the magnetic bar, and labels to the rug
6. Tell the children you are giving a lesson named Magnetism
7. Ask if they have ever heard of a magnet. Gather responses and vary your response according to the developmental level. Tell the children that our Earth has a special magnetic field that comes from the core. Some metals in rocks have magnetism. They act like magnets.
8. Take out the labels “magnetic” and “non-magnetic”  and place them at the top of the rug to form two columns. Read the label as you place it. This says “magnetic.” This says “non-magnetic.”
9. Take out the magnetic bar or wand. Say: “This is a large magnet.” 
10. Take out one magnetic item from the basket of items, such as a paper clip.
11. Say: “Look, do you see how the paper clips sticks to the magnet? This tells me that this paper clip has some magnetic properties. It is due to the metal, specifically iron that is used to make this paperclip.” 
12. Pick up another item from the basket such as a wood clothespin. Say: “Look, the wood does not stick to the magnet. Wood has no magnetic properties. We will put this clothespin in the non-magnetic column, here.” Place the clothespin under the label, “non-magnetic.”
13. Continue if needed or allow the child to continue to sort the items based on the presence of their magnetic properties or not. 
14. Thank the child for coming to lesson. Remind the child to clean up the work and make it ready for the next person. Show the child where it belongs on the shelf.

**Language/ Vocabulary:**\
Magnet, magnetic field, non-magnetic, magnetic property/ies, iron, core  of the earth

**Points of Interest:**
- The item sticking to the magnet bar or wand
- Not all metal is magnetic
- Guessing which are magnetic
- The attraction of the object to a magnet

**Control of Error:**
- Design cues: labels, the strength of the magnetic wand; most of the control of error lies in the work of the child
- Points of emphasis: making two columns, binary sorting

**Extensions:**
- A basket of bar (large) magnets so the children experience how magnets stick to magnets and how the poles of a magnet (positive and negative) operate
- Finding more magnetic and non-magnetic items around the classroom
- Show a compass and talk about the Magnetic North pole and how a compass works

**Presentation I:** (the following lesson is given with teacher made land and water materials instead of purchased land and water forms. If using fixed land and water forms, adapt the lesson accordingly.)

1. Invite the child to the presentation.  Thank the child for coming to lesson.
2. Bring the tray containing the plastic mat, the clay, the dish, the pitcher and the sponge to the chowkie. 
3. Either go and get or ask the child to go and get the Land and Water globe. Place it on the table next to the tray.
4. Ask the child to show you the water and land on the globe. Ask for a few examples.
5. Point to an island, such as Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean and ask the child if that that is land.
6. Tell the child that we are going to have a lesson about that type of land. It is called a land form- a form of land. 
7. Remove the tray from the table and place in on the floor next to the chowkie. Take the plastic mat and roll it out in on table. 
8. Take the clay in the container from the tray. Show the child how to open the container and remove the clay. Roll the clay into a ball if it is not in a ball.
9. Shape the clay into an irregular shaped disk. Compare the clay disk with Hawaii on the globe.
10. Tell the child that this is like that part of land on the globe. It is a land form. 
11. Move the clay disk to the edge and take the glass dish and pitcher. Remove the pitcher from the dish and place it at the top of the work area. 
12. Take the clay disk and place it in the center of the glass dish. Push it down so it adheres to the glass and shape more if needed or desired. 
13. Then, with special emphasis, take the pitcher. Slowly and carefully, pour the water so that it surrounds the clay disk. 
14. Put the pitcher down and sit back to admire the product. 
15. Draw the child’s attention using a few words pointing and saying land surrounded by water. “A piece of land surrounded by water is called an island.” Find Hawaii on the globe and make comparisons. 
16. Take the timer from the tray. Tell the child that we should only leave the water and the clay together for as long as the timer. Otherwise, it will get very messy! 
17. Show the child how and where to empty the water and return to the work area.
18. Invite the child to find a larger island. This could be Cuba, Java or the Philippines. Invite the child to shape the clay into a longer shape that resembles the selected island. 
19. As above, place it in the dish, pour the water and state the succinct definition of an island. 
20. Show the child how to put away the work. Return the clay to container. Carry the dish to the water source sink or class waste water bucket and pour the water out of the dish. Clean the dish with the sponge. Place the pitcher back in the dish and place both on the tray with the container of clay, the sponge and lastly, the rolled plastic mat. 
21. Return the work to the shelf with the child. Invite the child to return the globe to the shelf or map stand. 
22. Thank the child for coming to lesson.

**Presentation II:** Lake
1. Follow the same steps above until #5.
2. Point to a lake on the globe (without using the word “lake”; use “body of water” or “water form”)
3. Tell the child that we are going to have a lesson about that type of water. It is called a a water form- a form of water. 
4. Remove the tray from the table and place in on the floor next to the chowkie. Take the plastic mat and roll it out in on table. 
5. Take the clay in the container from the tray. Show the child how to open the container and remove the clay. Roll the clay into a ball if it is not in a ball.
6. Using both hands, flatten and roll the clay to make a long cylindrical shape. It should long enough to fit around the edges of the whole dish. Plan accordingly for the clay for this work.
7. Get the dish from the tray and place in the center of the work area. Then, remove the pitcher from the dish and place it at the top of the work area. 
8. Place the clay in the dish and press it to the edges, shaping it so that an elliptical center is exposed. 
9. Then, with special emphasis, take the pitcher. Slowly and carefully, pour the water into the center of the dish where there is not clay/ land. Put the pitcher down and sit back to admire the product. 
10. Find on the globe the lake that had been identified at the onset of the lesson. Point out the resemblances: land surrounded by water. “A body of water surrounded by land on all sides is a lake.” This water form is a lake. 
11. Take the timer from the tray. Tell the child that we should only leave the water and the clay together for as long as the timer. Otherwise, it will get very messy! 
12. Show the child how to clean up dumping the water in the classroom waste water bucket or drain.  
13. Invite the child to find another lake on the globe. This could be one of the Great Lakes or, it could be the Black Sea or the Mediterranean Sea since these water forms fit the same definition given: a body of water surrounded by land on all sides.  See Glossary for definitions and see link below in the lesson.
14. Invite the child to shape the clay to make the lake “revealed“ in the center of the glass dish. As above, pour the water carefully and state the succinct definition of a lake. 
15. Show the child how to put away the work. Carry the dish to the water source sink or class waste water bucket and pour the water out of the dish. Then, return the clay to container. Clean the dish with the sponge. Place the pitcher back in the dish and place both on the tray with the container of clay, the sponge and lastly, the rolled plastic mat. 
16. Return the work to the shelf with the child. Invite the child to return the globe to the shelf or map stand. 
17. Thank the child for coming to lesson.

**Notes:** Some “lakes” are called “seas” even though they are not; such as, the Caspian Sea. All seas are salty while lakes can be fresh or salty. All Seas have waters that lead to the ocean and are “sea” level; this is not true of lakes. See also:

## Mapping Earth: Continents & Cartography

### CONTINENT GLOBE (also known as the Globe of World Parts){.redc}

**Materials:**
- Montessori Continent globe
- Montessori Painted globe or Land and Water globe

**Prerequisites:** 
- Multiple lessons on the Land and Water globe
- Land and water forms lessons

**Direct Aims:**
- Bring attention to the colors on this globe
- Present the definition of a continent
- Understand large bodies of land in relation to each other

**Indirect Aim:**  
- Preparation for map of Word Parts
- Preparation for all mapping works
- Preparation for continent study

**Ages:** 3 - 5

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**

* Sensorial Level:
* Naming/Concept Level:
* Higher Order Thinking Level:

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the presentation.  Thank the child for coming to lesson.
2. Invite the child to walk to the shelf (or, map stand) where the Continent globe lives in the classroom.
3. Show the child how to pick up, hold and carry the Continent globe. Teacher can carry the Painted globe or Land and Water globe. 
4. Walk to the chowkie and set the globes in the center of the table
5. Initiate conversations about reviewing lessons that the child had on the Painted or Land and Water globe.
6. Begin to compare the two globes. Turn both globes to show North America. Point to the Painted globe or Land and Water globe and show the similarities regarding the land and water forms, shape and size of the continent. 
7. Point to the orange color. Tell the child that we are going to being to learn many facts about these large bodies of land. Pointing to North America, say, “This is a large (expansive) body of land on Earth, it is a continent.” 
8. Point to South America, “This is a large (expansive) body of land on Earth, it is a continent.” 
9. Continue to indicate all the continents on the globe.

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image045.webp" caption="Oceania" >}}

**NOTE A:**  In Montessori education, we classify, and color coordinate the continents as such;
North America – orange\
South America – pink\
Europe – red\
Africa – green\
Asia – yellow\
Oceania – brown\
Antarctica - white

**NOTE B:**\
There is not consistency among disciplines or nations about the names of the official continents of the world. Traditionally, in Montessori, we use the word “Oceania” for the southernmost continent primarily because this is the term that is used in the European languages where Montessori education started. It is, in many senses an accurate term because it avoids the confusion of “Australia” as a country versus “Australia” as a continent. “Australia” the continent (or, in this case, also “Oceania”) includes other countries besides the country Australia; it includes the New Zealand and most of the Polynesian islands. 
Choose a term to use that is understandable for your students and be consistent in all works, labels and extensions. 

10. At this point, there are various directions to take depending on the age and developmental level of the child. 
a. The names of some (or all, if ready) of the continents could be introduced with a three-period lesson.
b. The parts of continents surrounded by water (islands) and oceans could be introduced at this time. If for example, the Pacific Ocean is introduced at this time, using the Land and Water globe will be helpful by feeling (running your hand all around the Pacific Ocean) and naming at the same time the largest ocean on Earth. This will also bring up discussions of the island of Hawaii. We can share at this time that every piece of land on earth belongs to one of the continents. We could point to islands and show which continent they belong to. Hawaii (though we would not use the name of the state) to North America, Madagascar (without the name) to Africa, New Zealand to Oceania; Japan to Asia etc. Remember, in political terms, Greenland belongs to the European continent, to Denmark; even though it is orange and on the North America map in Montessori classrooms! 

11.  Show the child how and where to put the work away. Thank the child for coming to lesson.

**Points of Interest:**
- two globes
- the colors
- the names of the continents
- the word “continent”
- that all land on earth belongs to one of the continents

**Control of Error:**
- Accuracy of the material
- Teacher

**Variations:**
- Initiate conversations about knowledge or travel to and from continents. “How could a person get from North America to Africa?” 

**Extensions:**
- Initiate discussion of the continent differences based on the climate zones lesson. “What do you think the weather is like in the middle of South America compared with the upper part of North America?” 
- Bring in discussions from previous lessons about the equator, temperate and tropical zones
- Sing the continent song

* Higher Order Thinking Level:

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the child to the presentation.  Thank the child for coming to lesson.
2. Remind the child of the lesson about previous lesson on the globe, especially ones related to the poles and equator.
3. Tell the child that since humans have been on Earth, they have need to know where they are. Since the beginning of time, humans have used our star, the sun and the stars from other galaxies to tell them where they are on land and on water. 
4. Explain the four cardinal directions in terms similar to this to the child: 
Every day, no matter where we are on earth, we always see the Sun come up in the same place. This is because Earth always turns in the same (counterclockwise) direction. The sun rises in the East. No matter where we are on Earth, when we move in this direction (move finger to the East), we are going east, towards where the sun rises. You may want to choose another part of the globe and move your finger East, saying this is movement in the direction of East. 
After naming the cardinal point, hold it in the air to the LEFT of the globe.
5. Tell the child that this direction (demonstrating with the hand/ arm) is East but we must place the label on a surface so, we place it here (to the left) of the globe. 
6. Every day, no matter where we are on earth, we always see the Sun set in the same place. This is because Earth always turns in the same (counterclockwise) direction. The sun sets in the West. No matter where we are on Earth, when we move in this direction (move finger to the West), we are going West, towards where the sun sets. You may want to choose another part of the globe and move your finger West, saying this is movement in the direction of West.
7. After naming the cardinal point, hold it to the RIGHT of the globe.
8. Tell the child that the direction (demonstrating with the hand/ arm) is WEST but we must place the label on a surface so, we place it here (to the right) of the globe. 
9. Ask the child to point to the North Pole. Show the child that when we are travelling in this direction (moving your finger northward) no matter where we are on the globe, we are moving north.  Tell the child that just like we use the Sun to tell us where East and West is, we use another star to know where North is. It is called Polaris and the North pole points close to where it is. Choose a different location (even in the southern hemisphere) and demonstrate moving in a northern direction. 
10. Tell the child that when we are moving toward the North Pole and the star Polaris, we are going in the direction of North. Place the label on the surface in the standard position for north.
11. Repeat the same steps for South; moving towards the South Pole. There is no star for this direction! 
12. Remove the globe and look at the four cardinal point labels. Point and say, starting with North: North, East, South, West.
13. Thank the child for coming to lesson. Return the globe and labels.


**Points of Interest:**
- moving in the same direction on the globe no matter where we are
- the names of the directions
- the colors of the directions

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher

**Variations:**
- Present in a different order

**Extensions:**
- Play games with child’s finger on globe and giving commands of which direction to move.
- Play games from the North and South Poles. At each the poles, any movement is only the opposite. For example, from the North pole, movement in any direction is in the direction of south. Likewise, for the South Pole, movement in any direction is North. This is because Earth is a sphere!
- Play games identifying the opposite direction. “Direction is opposite of North?” if the child knows, right from left, play games of “What is to the left of south?” 
- Tell some of the story of Black Elk’s vision (which is the source of the colors for the labels) 
- Do some constellation work or parts of the day work.
- Introduce the terms for hemisphere; Northern and Southern Hemispheres 

**Vocabulary:**\
	North, East, South, West, Polaris

### MAP OF THE BODY

**Materials:**
- Long, wide paper (Newsprint is good for this activity since typically all the children want to map their bodies)
- Black marker 

**Prerequisites:**
- Model lesson
- Land and Water globe
- Earth’s elements lessons

**Direct Aims:**
- to make a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object 
- begin to see the differences between a 2D and 3D

**Indirect Aim:**
- Preparation for map work
- Preparation for puzzle maps

**Age:** 4.5 - 6

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**
* Sensorial Level:
* Naming/Concept Level:
* Higher Order Thinking Level:


**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the presentation.  Thank the child for coming to lesson.
2. Bring the large paper rolled up and the marker to an open area in the classroom
3. Tell the child that we are going to make a drawing of their body that is not a model but actual size.
4. Unroll the paper and secure the ends.
5. Invite the child to lie down on top of the paper.
6. Have the child slightly spread their legs and place their arms slightly away from their sides.
7. Begin up near the head and trace around the child. As you trace around the shoulder and down the arm, remind them that you will respect their body and only touch them when needed to make the outline. 
8. Trace all the around the child, including the arms, legs and all the way around the head.
9. When completed, ask the child to rise up.
10. Ask them to look at their outline. Tell them, “This is a map of your body.” “A map is a drawing on paper (2D) of something or someone that occupies space.” (“ It is a flat version of something that is not really flat.”) 
11. This map of your body is the real size. Hang up the body map. 
12. Tell the child that flat maps of something that is not flat can be tricky because we cannot see all sides. Show the child his right warm on their own body. Point to the right arm on the body map. It is reversed! This is why maps are tricky. Show the child that if you wanted the right arm to be on the same side as their body, they would have to lie face down and draw a body map or pretend that their body map is seen from their back.
13. The child may decorate, color and name the parts of their body: head, arm, foot, leg, elbow, hand etc.
14. Reiterate again, placing the child in front or on top of the body map that when we look at a flat, it is different than the real thing. It is not a model of a real thing; a map is a flat drawing of a real thing. It is not just the like the real, but it does help us learn about it just as a model does. 
15. Thank the child for coming to lesson.

**Points of Interest:**
- the large paper
- a work that involves their body
- a work centered on them

- 
**Indirect Aim:**
- Preparation for further mapping work
- Preparation for puzzle maps

**Age:** 3 - 5

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**

* Sensorial Level:
* Naming/Concept Level:
* Higher Order Thinking Level:


**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the presentation.
2. Assess if the child knows their right from left
3. Play a game: “Show me your hand, please. Oh no! I meant the other one. Show me your foot. Oh no, I meant the other one. Show me your ear. Oh no, I meant the other one. (each time ask for the opposite limb that the child shows you.) 
4. Tell the child you have an idea. I know a way that I can let you know which hand, foot or ear to show me.
5. Take the yarn and cut off a piece that is about 6-8 inches long. Take the child’s right hand and tell them that this side of their body is called the “right.” Take their wrist and wrap the yarn around their wrist and tie a bow. 
6. Resume the game. Can you show me the right arm? The right foot? The right ear? 
7. Tell the child that is not the “right” is called the “left.” Ask them to show you the right hand and then the left hand; the left foot and then the right foot, etc.
8. Take out the piece of paper and ask the child to place their right hand on the paper (palm down). Trace around the fingers and hand and the wrist. 
9. Ask the child to remove their hand. Draw the yarn piece around the wrist on the drawing. Write the word “right” below the hand. 
10. This is a map of your right hand. It is a drawing of flat drawing of your hand. We know it is your right hand because we drew the yarn. 
11. Show the child how you could draw their other hand. Gently take their left hand turned palm up and place it on top of the right hand drawing.  “This is not your right hand, tell them as you “give” them back their left hand. “It is the left hand turned around!”  That is why we label this one “right hand” and why we wear the yarn to know our right side of the body. 
12. Thank the child for coming to lesson.

**Points of Interest:**
- the game of “Oh, not that one!”
- using their body for the lesson

5. Ask the child what shape the shelf is - rectangular. Ask the child how they think the pieces of paper should go (i.e. portrait or landscape). Tell the child, you are going to use the whole piece of paper. Work with the child so that you both decided where the rectangular shape should be on the paper to use all the paper.  
6. Continue in this manner to engage the child in helping you draw the shelf. Elicit analysis by asking the child, what do you see on the top shelf, on the left? Shall we draw that? What do you see to the right of the X? Then what? Draw all the items on the top shelf. 
7. Do the same for the next horizontal shelf. Using left and right terminology and above and below position words, have the child tell you  what they see and where it should be represented on the paper. 
8. Do this for the whole shelf drawing work. 
9. When completed, tell the child that this is a map of the shelf. “We could use it to know where things go if we took everything off to clean it or if many works were being used. This map tells us where things are located. “Maps are not only fun to make, they are useful. This map is not real size like your hand and body were, but it is still a map and still useful. “

### TRANSITION FROM GLOBE (SPHERE) TO MAP HEMISPHERES (CIRCLES){.redc}

**Prerequisites:**
- Lesson on a sphere (geometric solids)
- Lessons and work with globes
- Understanding of land and water parts of the Earth
- Understanding that the Earth is a sphere

**Materials:**
- A double batch of dark blue playdough 
- Land and Water globe
- A large flat surface (board, very large tray or table top)
- A rolling pin
- Large knife (does not need to be sharp, just long)
- Clear laminated Eastern and Western hemispheres circles with the continents in brown to show the land parts of the Earth in brown. These can be made to fit perfectly with the world parts puzzle map in the classroom, however not necessary. If they are being made to match, the laminated hemisphere circles should be the same size as the hemisphere circles on the world map and the continents on the laminated hemispheres circles should be the same size and shape as the puzzle pieces of the world map.
- Map of the World Parts [aka World Map] (do not bring this to the rug until the end of the lesson)

**Direct Aims:**
- Prepare the child for using a flat map of the world as compared to a round globe

**Indirect Aims:**
-  To teach the children how we can flatten a sphere to make a two-dimensional globe to a map
- to show them how a map can cut the world into two hemispheres, East and West. 

**Ages:** 4-5

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite several children to the work area (hard surface or table). Thank them for coming to lesson.
2. Show them the large blue sphere of blue playdough.
3. Tell them: “Today, we are going to learn how map-makers, called cartographers, represent the Earth on a flat surface. Remember that you made a map of your hand? Your hand is not flat, but on the paper, it looks flat. That was a map of your hand. 
4. I am going to show you how cartographers represent Earth which is a huge sphere in a small flat piece of paper. 
5. Take the Land and Water globe and place it next to the blue playdough and compare it to the globe. Both are spheres. Show the children that if we want to see all the sides of the globe we turn it, but we cannot see it all at once; we have to wait until the part we want to see comes around. Remove the globe and put it on the floor next to the work area.
6. Take the long knife and slowly and carefully cut the playdough sphere in halves. Place each half sphere face down so the flat circle in facing downward. Show the child now, we can see both sides of the sphere at the same time. Point to both parts of the former sphere. 
7.  Tell the children that whenever we cut a sphere in half, we get a circle. Point and go around each side of the two half spheres pointing out the circle. Pick up one half sphere and show them the circle. Show them the other circle on the other half sphere.
8. Move one sphere to the side and pick up the rolling pin. Begin to roll out the blue playdough as you would a pie crust, making a large circle. Be sure it is being rolled out to fit the size of the laminated transition piece.
9. Set aside or simply move to the right and begin to roll out the second half of the blue playdough sphere with a rolling pin, again making sure to reach the same size as the laminated spheres. Both flatted half spheres should be next to each other and the same size. 
10. Say to the children, “Now, there are two circles from one sphere. Recap what you just did: we started with one sphere, we cut it in half and put the circle facing down, then, we flattened each one. Now, we have two large circles. 
11. We call these hemispheres; “hemi” means “half”. It is the half sphere, it is just flattened out. This is how cartographers show both sides of the world at once on a flat surface.
12. Take out the laminated hemisphere circles which should be out of sight until now.
13. Place the Western Hemisphere laminated piece over the blue playdough circle. Say: “Look, now we have one side of the Earth and we can see all the land (pointing to the brown areas) and all the water (pointing to the blue areas). This is a map of one hemisphere that shows all the land and water.” 
14. Place the Eastern Hemisphere laminated piece over the blue playdough circle. Say: “Look, now we have the OTHER side of the Earth right here in front of us and we can see all the land (pointing to the brown areas) and all the water (pointing to the blue areas). Together, this is a map of two hemispheres that show all the land and water of the whole Earth.” 
15. Say, “Maps give us flat images of the Earth but we know for a fact that Earth is not flat.” You can add “Even maps of our city or state can be flat, but we know that land is not always flat.” Add: “Maps are flat representations of a place that help us learn about and know that place.”
16. Tell them to close their eyes. Bring back the Land and Water globe. 
17. Find the view of the globe that matches the Eastern Hemisphere. Remind them that a map lets us see the whole view. Do the same for the Western Hemisphere. 
18. Show the child the work on the shelf that is a similar work of taking a blue sphere of playdough, making two half spheres and rolling them out to make hemispheres and then placing a laminate of the land forms on top. 
19. You can end the lesson here. Thank the children for coming to lesson.

**Presentation II:**
1. Go and get the Continent Globe and place it in the work area. Ask the children to point to a continent on the Continent globe. See if they can locate the same continent on the laminate in brown by shape. Continue to compare the continent globe to the laminate pieces over the blue playdough.
2. Ask the children to close their eyes. Go and get the Map of the world parts. Place it next to the blue playdough hemispheres and the continent globe. 
3. Elicit conversation of comparison of the Map of World Parts to the Continent globe. Remind them the puzzle map is the same as the continent globe, it just allows us to see whole Earth at once. 
4. Thank the children for coming to lesson.

**Language/ Vocabulary:** sphere, half sphere, circle, hemisphere, land, water, Map of World Parts or World map, continent, East, West

**Points of Interest:**
- Playdough and rolling it out
- Cutting the sphere in halves to make half spheres
- Placing the laminate over the blue circles

**Control of Error:**
- Design cues (if the laminate pieces are the exact size to match the puzzle map hemispheres and continents)
- Points of emphasis: cutting a sphere in two equal parts makes a circle at the base; when we have two flat circles from one sphere, we can see the whole surface of the sphere

**Variations:**
- Make the laminate transition pieces with the colored continents instead of brown and only use the continent globe in the lesson. (Using the Land and Water globe makes this lesson more accessible for all since it is usually done in a large group).

**Extensions:**
- Do the demonstration of peeling an orange or grapefruit after this lesson to again show how complicated it is to make a sphere flat. (It is impossible to project the surface of a sphere onto a plane without some distortion.) Show them a Goode projection (also known as an Interrupted projection) map as an example, explaining that some maps are made this way.

**Notes on Transition from round globe to flat map lesson:**\
This lesson is for demonstration and to introduce the Map of World Parts. This exact lesson is not typically a shelf work, but it is possible to make a smaller version for a shelf work. If done only as a demonstration without a corresponding shelf work, it is good to do this lesson with a large group of students.

Practice how much to roll out the playdough so it is neither too little nor too large. Check the amount of playdough needed. 
It is helpful to have a geometric solid sphere cut in half (often available at school supply stores, and sometimes in blue to match the Montessori versions) to show where the circle comes from in relation to a sphere. See image and supplier comments in lesson above: [PARTS OF THE EARTH: NOMENCLATURE](#parts-of-the-earth-nomenclature)

**Direct Aims:**
- Learn to carry and work with the Map of World Parts
- Recognize and identify the continents 

**Indirect Aim:**  
- Preparation for further mapping work
- Preparation for continent puzzle maps
- Prepare for continent studies

**Age:** 3 - 6

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**

* Sensorial Level:
* Naming/Concept Level:
* Higher Order Thinking Level:

**Introduction:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson.
2. Tell the child that this first lesson is very important and that they will need it for many future lessons and work they do with maps.
3. Invite the child to go with you to the map stand.
4. Show the child where the maps are kept, showing how many beautiful puzzle and control maps the classroom has.
5. Demonstrate how to take hold of the puzzle map and withdraw it slowly from the stand. (vary this demonstration according to the type of map stand in the classroom)
6. Show the child how to take the puzzle map all the way out of the stand and how to carry it. Proceed to carry the map around the classroom, being mindful of other students, furniture and rugs with works out. Demonstrate how hold the map on the sides in the center (for balancing the weight of the map) and to hold the bottom edge pressed against the body.
7. Place the map back in the stand. Ask the child to take a map and practice walking to the work area. Show the child how to carefully place the map on the rug, by leaning/ kneeling low and placing the top edge down and then, lowering the bottom edge to the rug. 
8. Tell the child that now that they are using the maps, they will often to make many trips to get various things to do map work! “Its big work!” 
9. Return to the map stand and show the child where the control charts are located. Show the child how to carefully carry the control chart.*
10. Ask the child to put it on the rug and come back to the map stand.
11. Hand the child the labels for the Map of World Parts and go to the run together.\
*It is a very good idea to consider mounting laminated control maps on hard board. 

**Presentation I:**
1. Show the child that when we set up map work, we place the puzzle map on the LEFT and the control map on the right. The labels can be in a convenient, reachable place on the rug.   
2. Begin by showing (without words) the three fingers that are going to be used to pick up the map pieces – make a pincer grip that opens and closes.  Pick up North America with an emphasized pincer grip on the knob and, with one slow and careful movement, place it on the control chart. Next, do the same for South America. You may to invite the child to help here or later. Place the small piece of Asia in the Western hemisphere after North and South America.
3. Do a three-period lesson for those three map pieces. 
4. If the child is ready, continue with the Eastern hemisphere. Do a three-period lesson to assess identification of the continents.
5. Invite the child to return the map pieces to the puzzle map. Ask if the child would like to place them again all by themselves. If not, they can clean up or you can continue with nomenclature. 
6. Take out the labels of the continents. Read a label to the child. Hand it to them and ask them to place it on top of the puzzle piece on the control chart.  Continue for all continents as long as the child is ready and receptive. 
7. Remind the child how to lean down and pick up the map and carry it to the map stand. Ask the child to go back to the rug and get the control map. 
8. Thank the child for coming to lesson.

**Presentation II:** Nomenclature
1. Bring the Continent globe and the Map of World parts to the rug.
2. Review the names of the continents using both the map and globe
3. Recall with the child the Four Directions work when you talked about: North/ East/ South/West using the Continent globe. 
4. Ask the child to place the Four Direction cards around the globe as in Four Directions lesson.
5. Remove the globe, leaving the Four Direction cards in place. Remind the child puzzle map this is the same as the globe, it is just a flattened sphere. 
6. Place the label of North at the top of the puzzle map
7. Invite the child to place the next ones.  Tell the child, “All maps have the four directions since they help us know where we are. All our puzzle maps have North at the top.” 
8. Tell the child there are some other things we can label on this map.
9. Remind the child of the Transition From Sphere to Map lesson with the blue sphere of playdough being rolled out. When we cut the sphere in half, we called it a “half sphere” or hemisphere. Western Hemisphere circle and say, “this is a hemisphere (point to the blue circle, tracing around the entire edge). This is West, pointing to the label on the map. We call this the “Western Hemisphere.” I am going to place this label that says Western hemisphere above the Western Hemisphere on our Map of World Parts. 
10. Say, the child, “Can you show me another hemisphere on our map?” 
11. Point to East and then say “This is the Eastern Hemisphere, and I am going to place the label above the Eastern Hemisphere. 
12. Take our the geometric solid of the half sphere. Remind the child that when you did the Transition from Sphere to Map lesson, you cut the sphere “this way”: show a vertical cut and show the half sphere. 
13. Tell the child that we could cut a sphere “this way” (horizontally) and also get a circle! Show them the geometric solid of the half sphere again so that the flat part is facing up. Or if there are two half spheres, so that each half meets in a horizontal position. 
14. Ask the child, “Does this remind you of our equator lesson – that imaginary line that goes all the way around Earth and makes two equal pieces?” 
15. If necessary, bring the globe back out and show where the equator is.
16. Take the red ribbon and place it across both hemispheres. This represents the equator and how we have made two hemispheres that are each made up of two half circles.
17. Point to the two half circles above the equator and say, “Together, these make one hemisphere. “This is a hemisphere. Point to the label, North, and say, “This is the Northern hemisphere.” 
18. Point to the two half circles below the equator. Say, “Together, these make one hemisphere. “This is a hemisphere. Point to the label, South, and say, “This is the Southern hemisphere.” 
19. Review and possibly do a three period lesson on all four hemispheres: eastern, western, northern and southern. 
20. Optional: Ask the child if they would like to learn some other very special words for naming the parts of the world:
Occident: Western Hemisphere\
Orient: Eastern Hemisphere (for example, Oriental)\
Boral: Northern Hemisphere (for example, aurora Borealis: lights of the Northern hemisphere)\
Austral: Southern Hemisphere (for example, Australia: “of the Southern hemisphere”)
 
**Presentation III:** Oceans
1. Bring the Map of World Parts to the rug. Review the continents. 
2. Bring out the Continent globe. Ask the child, “Did you know the waters on Earth have names just like the continents?” 
3. Select a large body of water, such as the Pacific Ocean and have the child feel and see it. Ask what continents the Pacific Ocean touches? 
4. Look on the Map of the World parts and find the same body of water. And, find the same continents that border it. Take time, at this point to help them understand how the Ocean may be divided into the two hemispheres on a map. Remind them of the previous lessons about transitioning from a sphere to a plane. 
5. When teaching about the Southern Ocean, use the Continent globe and take if off the stand. Rub with your hand all around Antarctica to indicate where the Southern Ocean lies. Likewise, show on the map that it is in both hemisphere pieces, but it is one ocean.

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image053.webp" alt="Map of World" >}}

The 5 world oceans are: Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Artic Ocean, Southern Ocean.

**Points of Interest:**
- recalling previous lessons and knowledge
- the globe and the map together in one lesson
- learning the names and colors of the continents

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher

{{< img class="white-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image055.webp" alt="Map of South America" >}}

**Variations:**
- Sing the continent song with the lesson

**Extensions:**\
There are MANY extensions for this lesson. Most all are regular works in the classroom.
- Playdough of all colors of the continents and outlines on plexiglass or laminate. The student puts pinches of playdough on the surface to fill in the shape of the continent with the corresponding color. 
- Paint a blue large sheet of paper. Use the hemisphere circle (a separate material from the puzzle map supplier) to trace the hemispheres. Cut them out. Pin-punch the continents and glue them on the hemispheres. Mount the 2 hemispheres on a large white paper. Or, cut the blue hemispheres out of construction paper and glue the pin-punched continents on. 
- Make a paper maché globe and glue on the continents
- Follow the above directions for counting the continents on blue circles. Instead of gluing to a flat surface, but them back to back and use a single hole punch to make lacing holes. Use white yarn to sew them together. Stop near the end and fill with stuffing/batting and then close and tie knot.
- Make a continent booklet
- Make a booklet of the Northern hemisphere and/ or southern hemisphere.
- Use water color or water color pencils to color the continents on map. Use different blues to make the different oceans.

{{< div class="figcaption center" >}}
TIP: since the children make SO many maps and want to be independent, (and you need them to be with this task!) consider making a stencil of each continent for them. Trace the continent piece on cardstock, use Xacto knife to cut, then laminate, then cut out middle again.

#### A note on cartography:

Children at this age adore cartography. In addition to making many maps with the Montessori puzzle maps, they love to make other maps. There are many works that can be created that teach and practice cartography skills, even using a legend and scale.

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image059.webp" alt="Road Mat">}}

**Work ideas:**\
Make and laminate a map of your local community. It can include roads, parks, schools, the public library, stores, rivers, bridges and other natural and man-made places. You may want to simplify the network of roads and streets and include walking trails and parking lots.

Once the map is created, a real or an imaginary town, you can make all kinds of games that involve the directionality, literacy and mapping. They can have bicycles to move about (i.e. eco-friendly transportation) based on reading short direction cards. For example, “Go north toward the tall yellow building and take the first right. Turn left at the “T” in the road and go to the bridge. Park your bike and go fishing in the stream.” This could be partner work for readers and non-readers. 

{{< img class="white-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image061.webp" alt="My Map Book Cover">}}

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image063.webp" alt="Follow that Map Conver">}}


There are many children’s books based on maps. Since they do not know how to situate themselves in time yet, situating themselves in space is very rewarding and entertaining. 
Children like to map the playground, their bedroom, how to get to school, the park etc. They can draw and write this.

Bringing the lessons in Culture to the other areas of the classroom enlivens and connects the learning experience.

### THE FLAG{.redc}

**Materials:**
- American flag (Regular size for household flagpole, if possible)
- An American flag with pieces that come part (canton, stripes, etc.)
- Other sample flags from other countries
- A sample flag pole (a small replica or a picture of one)
- Labels (pre-made or paper and marker/ pencil to write during the lesson)

**Prerequisites:** 
- Puzzle maps 
- Country Research
- Discussions and readings about different cultures

**Direct Aims:**
- Teach the significance and importance of symbols of national identity
- Teach them the parts of the flag; to identify that American flag

**Indirect Aim:**
- Prepare for flag making work
- Prepare for learning flags from other countries

**Age:** 4-5

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite a few children to rug
2. Talk to the children about a flag. Ask them to locate one in the classroom (or other place); Ask them what they know about a flag.
3. Take out the large American flag and spread it on the floor, slowly and very respectfully.
4. Take a moment to look at it in silence. Tell them that flags are normally never on the floor but for this lesson, just today we are going to have this lesson on a rug, on the floor. If you have a flag hanging in the room, show them that the flag always hangs.
5. Explain to the children that a flag is related to our country’s identity. Make comparisons between national identity and individual identity (skin/hair color, heritage/ cultural associations). Tell them another identity that we call share is that we are all American even though we all look different.
6. Explain that all countries have a national flag. Show them samples of other flags.

**Presentation II:**
1. Invite the children to come to the rug
2. Remind the children of the lessons on the actual American flag. 
3. Take out the flag with the detachable parts. Remove the labels from the basket and keep them in stack in one corner of the rug.
4. Begin with the field part of the flag. Lay it down, smooth it out and tell the children “This is the field of the flag.” Write the word “field” on a piece of paper or find the label and place it next to the field. For example, on the lower left side of the rectangle. Next, take out the canton (with the stars attached) and place it in the upper left corner of the field of the American flag. Say “This part of the American flag is the canton”.  Tell them there are 50 stars, one for each state in the United States. Tell them “one star is for our state” and name your state.
5. Next, remove the white stripes from the basket and lay them all to the right of the rectangle. Slowly and carefully place the white stripes as they go on the American flag. Remember that the American flag has a red stripe at the top and the bottom thus, the six white stripes go in between. There are three short stripes to the right of the canton and three long stripes go beneath.
6. After assembling the flag, tell the students “This is how the American flag is designed.” Tell them you are going to name the other parts of the flag. Point to the fly and tell them we can remember it because it is the part that moves the most in the wind. Take the label or a paper to write the word and then place it next the right-hand edge. 
7. Show them a picture or a model flag pole. Show them how it attaches to the pole and, if the model flag will fit on the model pole, attach it. Tell them the name of this side of the flag is called the hoist. Tell them this is also the word we use to mean “raise” the flag. We “hoist” a flag which means to pull it up the pole. Tell them this is also the same word to name the side of the flag attached to the pole. Place a label or write a label and place it next to the hoist of the flag. 
8. Lay the pole down on the floor. Tell them that now you are going to tell them the parts of the pole and then we are going to practice hoisting and lowering the flag, and then, they will learn to walk with it.
9. Point to the halyard. Tell them this is the part that we pull down on to raise it up. Write or place the label next to the halyard.
10.  Point to the finial. Tell them this word means “end” and it is the top of the pole, where it ends. 
11. If there are other parts of the pole, such as cleats, point, name and label them

**Presentation II:**
1. Invite the children to the rug. Remind them of the lesson on the special nature of the flag, such as we never put it on the floor, step on it etc. 
2. Tell the children there are certain ways to hang the flag (vertical, horizontal, half-mast) and explain each. Tell them flags are also used to soldiers who have died in war as a way of recognizing and thanking them for your service to our country. You can have a picture of a soldier’s casket draped with the flag. 
3. Tell them children you are going to demonstrate walking with a flag on a flagpole. Stand up, carefully pick up the flagpole and walk around the ellipse, showing how to not let it touch the floor, how to hold it steady and finally how to place it in a stand or holder. 
4. (Optional) Show the children how to fold a flag. Take out the large flag (household / classroom size). If the classroom flag is not removeable from the pole, you will not be able to use it.

**Language/ Vocabulary:** fly end, hoist, field, canton, halyard, flagpole, finial

**Points of Interest:** Assembling the American flag with the various pieces; attaching and detaching the flag from the pole; the new vocabulary

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image065.webp" alt="Flag at Funeral" >}}

**Control of Error:**
- Design cues: length of the white stripes
- Points of emphasis: canton with its 50 stars

**Variations:**
- Use a different flag such as Canada whose canton is the center portion with the leaf.

**Extensions:**
- Go outside to the school flagpole and raise and lower the flag showing all the parts of the flag and the flag pole.

**Notes:** see below for directions on how to fold a flag

### COUNTRY / CONTINENT BOOKLETS OR PROJECTS

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image068.webp" alt="The Animal Atlas Cover" >}}

**Materials:**
* Puzzle maps
* Continent folders/boxes
* Atlases (with physical geography that show lakes, mountains, animals, natural resources etc.) 
* Animal sets by biome or continent
* Book of flags

**Prerequisites:**
* Lessons on the Puzzle Maps
* Lessons on biomes
* Lesson on flags

**Direct Aims:**
- To integrate areas of language, culture, art and practical life in a study of a region

**Indirect Aims:**
- Prepare for other country / region studies
- Prepare for further geography lessons in Elementary

**Age:** 4-6

**Explanation:** 
There are a huge number of interest-based projects that individual students or small groups of students can do related to continent, state or region studies. These are best done when multiple areas of the curriculum are brought together; Practical life, Art, Language and Culture.

**Projects ideas include:**
- Baking/ cooking
- Do “research” on a topic and making a booklet. For examples, animals of the Unites states, birds of Wisconsin, plants in Alaska etc. 
- Maps/ posters/ booklets of physical features such as mountains, lakes etc. 
- Recording (writing, drawing, copying) the language of the selected area, the flag(s), the customs, the weather, the clothing, the capital, the man-made monuments etc.
- Sewing projects (see image below)
In order for these and other projects to be done, the classroom needs to have resources on hand (various types of atlases, see image above) and/or prepared works, such as the animals of South America (see image below). 

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image070.webp" caption="This work could easily be differentiated by adding descriptions of the animals and making a guessing game out of it. Also, this work could then be used for booklet making: drawing and labeling the animals." >}}

It is helpful to remember that if there are Elementary Montessori classrooms in your school, this is an excellent place to get black line masters for country and/ or an activity on a certain feature of physical geography of a continent/ country. For examples, the waterways in North America.

{{< figure class="white-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image072.webp" caption="Integrating Culture into all areas of the classroom is best practice. This could be on the Practical Life shelf or the Culture shelf." >}}

**Ideas for a continent Study across the areas of the EC classroom: Africa**
1. Language: image to image matching of all kinds of African faces, of fabric pieces; grasses of the savanna
Language: writing with dotted cursive / print some words in Swahili (with pictures)\
Language: three-part cards of names of mountains (Kilimanjaro, Kenya, Meru), rivers (Nile, Congo, Niger, Volta), lakes (Victoria, Malawi, Kivu, Chad)\
Language: put couscous in “sand” tray
2. Practical life: transfer cinnamon sticks with tweezers, pour couscous, pour cumin seeds;  
3. Sensorial: spices from Africa: cinnamon grating; tasting: ginger, vanilla beans; toasted sesame seeds
4. Math: use kola nuts for 1-10 correspondence; Do a guessing quantity work with anise seeds in a jar; count the countries on the political map; draw the largest and smallest and label them.

{{< box class="white-outline white-bg w-400 float-left" >}}
{{< div class="font-bold" >}}The Origin of the Headwrap:{{< /div >}}
{{< div class="p-1" >}}The headwrap originated in sub-Saharan Africa, and was often used to convey modesty, spirituality and prosperity. Even men in Africa wear head wraps to symbolize wealth and social status. Head wrapping is literally a way that African’s for centuries have been able to non-verbally communicate their place in life. The headwrap of a woman walking down the street will tell you if she’s a widow, a grandmother, or if she’s a married young woman. It’s an element in the daily living of an African woman. Headwraps also serve a practical function in protecting the head from the rays of the sun. In West Africa, head wraps are referred to as ‘gele’ in Yoruba or ‘ichafu’ in Ibo.{{< /div >}}
{{< /box >}}


5. Art: Music to listen to on Mp3; drums to play; banjo; invite a drummer to come and play various drums; color a fixed coloring of an indigenous plant (see below); Print 2 pictures of the continent’s natural features, skies etc. Cut a piece out of one of the matching images, the other is the control. The student has to find which pieces go to what image.
6. Food for community gathering: Mealie Pap traditional porridge made from maize)
 http://abambotravel.com/traditional-south-african-food-kids-will-love/
Food for individual snack: Plantain chips

**Another idea: study head wraps**

{{< img class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/culture/geo/image075.webp" alt="Head Wrap 1" >}}
{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/culture/geo/image077.webp" alt="Head Wrap 2" >}}


You can use black and white images such as this on the art shelf for a fixed coloring. Don’t forget to color one with true colors, laminate it and place it with the coloring work. Also, place the colors needed to color the picture with the work. Suggestion: make small images approx. 5.5x5.5. If you change the image each day, they can have a booklet of plants of Africa by the end of the week.

{{< img class="white-outline float-right pure-img" src="/img/culture/geo/image079.webp" alt="Picture of Branch">}}


Continent Studies are very open ended, and up to the teacher to implement as s/he chooses. They can include field trips (to an exhibit, to a restaurant for lunch, to a poetry reading at the library etc.), works in as many areas of the classroom as possible, visual reminders around the classroom with images of the cultures of the continent and finally, the celebration of a holiday from a certain culture. Often, these studies include some food aspect, often as a collective snack with the food specialty. Take advantage of the diversity of your classroom to get help in presentations, procuring objects (such as money, postcards etc.) and oral histories.

- Extensions of Map of World Parts

**Direct Aim:**
- See and identify countries within a continent
- familiarize child with political geography

**Indirect Aims:** 
- To prepare the student for all other puzzle map work
- To prepare for country study
- To prepare for Flag work and other political geography lesson

**Age:** 3-5

**Levels for Presentations (based on “levels of understanding”):**
* Sensorial Level:
* Naming/Concept Level:
* Higher Order Thinking Level:

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the child to lesson, naming the work and ask them to get out two rugs.   
2. Go to the map cabinet or stand in the classroom.
3. Show the child where the North America map is located
4. Ask the child to carry the map to the rug 
5. Return to the map area and show them where the control map is located.
6. Child may go back for the Continent globe or the teacher may carry it. Walk to the rug together. Depending on the number of presentations for which the child may be ready in one sitting, the country labels for the countries of North America may be brought as well. 
7. Have the child set up the map and control exactly the same way as the Map of World Parts; puzzle on the left and control on the right.
8. Pick up the Continent globe and ask the child to identify the North America.
9. Remind the child that a map is a flattened (2 – dimensional ) globe. Remind them of the blue playdough lesson, if needed.
10. Outline with your index finger the edges of North America on the Continent globe. 
11. Then, placing the Continent globe to the left of the North America map, point out the similarities of the two shapes.
12. Show the child or ask the child about the similarities. The top (northern Canada) and the bottom (Panama) are good places to show the parallels in the shape.
13. Say, “The continent of North America has many parts to it; these are called countries. I am sure you are going to recognize some of these names, I share with you.” 
14. Choice: some guides start with United States, since this is our country. Some guides start with Canada. If you start with the United States, you may have to immediately address Alaska as part of the United States but not connected. Some children will notice this while other will not. For this reason, it is sometimes easier to start with Canada and work your way South and address Alaska at the end.
15. Pick up Canada, emphasizing how to hold by the knob and that the large pieces droops down. Show them how to carefully place it on the control map. Say. “This is Canada.” 
16. Slowly look back at the puzzle map. Pick up the United States piece, again demonstrating how to hold the piece when the knob is not in the middle. Place the piece on the control map. Say, “This is the United States. This is our country; we live here.”
17. Proceed slowly to Mexico, pointing out that the pieces are getting smaller. Place Mexico on the control map.
18. Do a three-period lesson for the initial three countries using the control map.
19. Labels can be used at this point, or you can proceed to introduce a few more pieces, checking for retention with the three-period lesson.
20. Typically, we would not introduce all the pieces at once. After the initial three, we can stop and invite the child to trace and pin-punch it or cut it out.  Alaska can be presented at the same time as continental US puzzle piece, or later in the sequence.
21. Further presentations include placing each piece on the control map and naming each country in North America.\

### PUZZLE MAP OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA{.redc}

**Materials:**
* Puzzle map of North America
* Puzzle map of the Unites States
* Control map of the United States
* Labels of the four directions
* Labels of the United States (mounting the state names on the state color is helpful and storing them my color as well especially if using the state color method explained below under #10 of the presentation). 

**Prerequisites:**
* Lesson on the Map of World Parts
* Lessons on the Puzzle Map of North America

**Direct Aims:**
- Learn one’s home state name and shape
- Learn other state names and shapes in the United States

**Indirect Aims:**
- Prepare for other country studies
- Prepare for further geography lessons in Elementary

**Age:** 4-6

**Presentation:**
1. Invite the child to lesson
2. Ask the child to get two large rugs and place them side by side.
3. Go the map area and select the puzzle map of North America. Then also select the map of the United States.
4. Place the puzzle map of North America on the left-hand rug. Place the map of the United States on the right-hand rug.
5. Take the piece of the United States out of the North American puzzle map. Bring it close to the United States and point out on area on the perimeter of the puzzle piece, such as where the state of Florida is, and show where that is on the United States map. Ask the child to locate another feature on the United States piece from the North America puzzle and then locate it on the United States puzzle. This could be the area of Maine or that of coastline of the western united states, Washington, Oregon and California. Ensure if possible that the child understand that the pieces are the same, only one is in more detail and bigger. 
6. Pointing to the one piece from the North America map, say “This is the whole country of the United States of America” and then pointing to the large U.S.A. map say. “ This is the same U.S.A. with the parts of the country. Each of these pieces is a part of the whole country. Each one is called a state.”
7. Restore the one U.S.A. piece to the N.A. puzzle. Point to the U.S.A. map and while selecting (pointing and picking up) various states of various sizes and colors say, “This is a state, and this is a state, and this is state… there are 50 states in all.”
8. Say, to the child, “I am going to show you our state; the state we live in.” Choose your state and make its outline with your finger, tracing around the perimeter. Say, “this is the state of X.” 
9. Ask the child to replace the piece and then to cover his eyes. Say, “Now, open your eyes and show me which one is our state.”
10. Tell the child that you are going to help them learn several other states and you are going to help them. 
• There are two standard ways to begin to learn the states. 
1. Start with the home state and learn the states that border the home states. Then, slowly radiate out or choose another state they know of and learn those border states. The rationale for this is that children may well have heard of the border states of their home state and may recognize the names. Also, they may know other state names (a vacation, relative who lives there etc.) and this provides a scaffold for learning

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image083.webp" alt="North America vs Alaska">}}

2. States by color – 1st Pink: Maine, California, Montana, Illinois, Texas, Florida, Alaska, Virginia and Nebraska. Then, choose another color, often gray which border the pink states and then yellow which again, border nearly all the gray states. The rationale for starting with the pink states is that most of these states are both large puzzle pieces (which contributes to faster memorization of shape) and several are perimeter pieces with further contributes to identification by shape. Lastly, the pink states include Alaska, a distinctive state due to its location away from the continental United States and its very large size, though not represented on most U.S puzzle maps. It is helpful to have the N.A. puzzle map handy to show where actually Alaska is located and how large it truly is. Remember, that all maps have some kind of distortion (see early cartography lessons). The Alaska piece location and size are a good example of this distortion.

11. Before beginning to learn the states, but after pointing out Alaska, return the map of N.A. to the stand. Bring the U.S.A control map to the rug. Slide the U.S.A puzzle map the left-hand rug and the place the U.S.A control map on the right-hand rug. Take the labels for the Four Directions (North, South, West and West) and place them accordingly on the control map. 

12. BORDER STATES METHOD: For learning bordering states around the home state, move the home state to the Control map, name it and place the label on it.  Say, the state to the East, indicating the direction pointing to the Direction label is X. For example, the state to the east of Wisconsin (beyond the lake) is Michigan. Using the Four directions, show what the border states are for the home state. Move one piece at a time, indicating the direction and placing the label. 

13. STATES BY COLOR METHOD: Take the labels (nine) for the PINK states and line them in a column on the right-hand side of the rug. Choose one of the perimeter PINK states, such as Texas, Maine, Florida, California. Pick up the piece, name it and place it on the control map. Name it again and place the label, pointing out the first letter and/or the sounds if the child is reading or doing pre-reading. Do the same for all the pink states.

14. Invite the child to do an extension with those initial nine states. Some include:
	* Remove the labels and play a game (or move away from the work area, taking the labels with and ask the child to come to you for the labels) by reading the name of the state and having them place it on the state.
	* Invite the child to color and label a black line master of the US map – only the pink states.
	* Invite the child to pin-punch the pink states making a booklet.  
15. After the child has worked with extensions on the pink states and has mastered some or all of them by name, proceed with the next color. Before beginning the next color, name and place all the pink states on the control map. Then tell the child that you are going to start with the next color. 
16. Gray typically follows pink well since all the gray states touch the pink states. Lay out the seven labels for the gray states on the right hand-side of the rug. Repeat as in the above steps, placing the state by color on the control map with the label. 
17. Yellow is a logical next color since most border gray states; Ohio and Connecticut are the exceptions of the seven states. Purple is a good next color to pursue. Proceed to introduce states by color, each time reviewing the previous ones for a reasonable level of mastery based on the child and being methodical about the color choice.\
⇒ There is no expectation that a 3-6 year old learn a certain number of states by name. They will learn based on interest and sometimes this will be many or sometimes few. They may be more interested in the learning the shapes and they fit together without retaining the names; this is perfectly acceptable and in fact, excellent indirect preparation for learning the names at a later time.

**Language/ Vocabulary:**  All the state names

**Points of Interest:**
- Many puzzle pieces 
- Colors and the underlying intention of the color system (for example, all gray states border pink states)
- The home state and its neighboring states
- States that have been visited or where relatives live

**Control of Error:**
- Control map and color-controlled state names
- Teacher
- Labeled control state map (perhaps is the Continent binder of North America)

**Variations:** 
- Start with a different state and radiate out from there
- Start with a different color than pink

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image085.webp" caption="State flag of Alaska" >}}

**Extensions:**
- Those mentioned above in the lesson under #14
- Combine with Moveable alphabet work to write the names of the states.
- Look up flags and make flags for various states. 
- Given the lesson on the placement of the knob – the state capital. Look up the name of each state capitals of each state studied in the group
- Make booklets of the state with capital, flag, population, language etc.

## History: Time and Earth’s Change

### INTRODUCTION

_Some excerpts from my article on “The Timelessness of the Young Child”:_

Young children only understand time as it relates to their bodies – “two sleeps” means two nights which is often how adults explain two ‘days’ to a young child. Even with the analogy using the concrete form they know best – their own bodies- they do not really understand time; its duration, its infinite and unceasing nature and finally, how adults live so closely by, for and with time. Children about five years old and younger remain by their nature and in their cognitive capacities outside of time. This “timelessness” is actually a very special place to which virtually none of us are able to return. As adults or teens, we do not remember this timelessness period of our lives precisely because we were outside of time. We can access  memories that are not anchored with cognitive time stamp. We may have a memory of ourselves as a three or four-year-old, but we likely do not remember ourselves much when we did not understand time at all.

Teaching children time - what it is, how it to measure it and its role in people’s lives creates challenges because time is both an abstract concept and virtually invisible (only the effects of time are visible). As mentioned above, children from birth to about five years old do not have the cognitive maturation to understand time; anything much beyond the present moment. While we are initiating children into the study of time and into a “timed-world”, let us remember the very precious and special timelessness of the young children. They live only in the present.

Being in the present has terrific benefits as any adult who practices meditation and mindfulness knows. I hypothesize that children’s state of being in the present moment promotes concentration; being in the present moment reduces most anxiety or regrets about the future or the past; being in the present moment allows them to promptly “forgive and forget” ; and finally, being in the present moment - in timelessness - allows them to be in an eternal present. I further theorize that this eternal present is the source of their sense of joy, their laughter, their light heartedness and their overall happiness especially when compared to any older age group.

I am suggesting that being “caught in timelessness”  allows young children to see many details of their present environment and likely contributes to their Sensitive periods of order and for small objects. Living and ‘doing’ in the present further contributes to their immediate appreciation of beauty, harmony and their sense of wonder. Very young children do not ask questions of why or how as those too, are also bound in notions and understandings of time; of cause and effect. A full moon or a painted picture is fully beautiful and wonderous simply in and of itself with the child; not for any other reason. As adults, we can learn, respect, and maintain great appreciation this special period of timelessness in a young child’s life – it will pass (in time!) and never return again.

**HISTORY**\
Indirect preparation for lessons related to time have likely already begun with lessons in the curricular branch of Physical Science (**Earth in Space**{{< span class="redc" >}}/ Earth and Sun; Earth and Universe {{< /span >}} etc. ) when the rotation and revolution of Earth around the sun and/or the solar system is demonstrated and discussed. Furthermore, an initiation into history and time have likely already begun with the Montessori birthday celebration- the story / history of the child’s life as it unfolds according to nature; the revolutions of Earth around the sun to make the years of their age. As they walk in a counter-clock wise direction around a candle that represents the sun, the guide narrates their life story- their timeline of life, as it were.

Lessons on day and night have also likely been introduced with early lesson on {{< span class="redc" >}}Earth and Sun{{< /span >}}. While we do not expect the three to five-year-old child to fully understand time in this “astronomical” sense, we offer these impressionistic lessons and classroom practices to provide a preliminary concrete example of the abstract concept of time. If these lessons from Physical Science, the birthday celebration or the Solar System have not been given, then it is highly recommended to begin first with these lessons that are found in the early sections of this album.

### TIME: INTRODUCTORY LESSON{.redc}

**Prerequisites:**
* Earth in space
* Solar system 
* Earth’s rotation and revolution around the sun
* Birthday celebrations (optional)

**Materials:**
- Images of the earth in space and the universe
- Sand timers (30 second, one-minute etc)
- Image of a sun dial
- Outdoor area (with black top or macadam) with trees or objects to see shadows (optional)

**Age:** 4-6

**Presentation I:** Taking one’s pulse
1. Invite the children to the rug. Tell the students that you are going to talk about Time. First a little story about how time came to be.  Weave these facts together to create a story of time
- Time started with the great explosion of light: the Big Bang. This is when the universe was born and it’s when scientist believe time started. They are not sure but they think this is true. 
- Time never stops; it always keep going. In fact, the Earth is millions and millions of years old. That means the earth has gone around the sun millions and millions of times. 
- Even if an elderly person, like a grandmother were to walk around the candle the number of time that the earth has been around since she was born, it probably wouldn’t even be one hundred. 
- Time has been going for a very, very, very, very long time!! 
- We cannot stop time… we can’t not grow older. Isn’t that interesting? We can stop in time, stop a car but we can never stop time from passing.
- We can speed up time… we cannot go to the future. We can only be right now… and then that moment is gone, and we call it “history.” History is another word for “story.”  The past is a story because that is the only way we can talk about – by explaining what happened- a story. 
- Time that has past is called history. Time that has not yet come is called the future. Now, is called the present. Right now! Oh! That is gone. NOW! Oh! that is gone.  Etc.  
- You see, you cannot stop time from passing.  There really is nothing else like it on Earth, except for energy. 

2. Tell the children that early humans began to understand time with their bodies and then with the Earth and sun. 

3. Ask the children to extend one of their arms with the wrist face up. Show them how to put their two fingers on the wrist to feel the pulse. Help them each find their pulse/ heartbeat. If the wrist is unsuccessful, show them how to place two fingers deep under the back edge of the jawbone (on either side) as an alternative place to take one’s pulse. 

4. After each has located their heartbeat, ask them to being to count softly the beats. After they have gotten used to their heart beat, tell them that we are going to measure time using their heat beat.  Select a few children who have similar heart beat rates and have them count aloud as each beat happens: 1,2,3,----- 27,28,29,30. 

5. Take out a 30 second timer. Place the timer in the middle. Ask each child to being counting to themselves as soon the timer is turned over and the guide says, “ Begin!”  Some will lose track of their counting and that is not important. The point of the lesson is that early humans used their bodies to help them understand time.  

6. Tell the children that the heart beat is a like a timer in our bodies that beats every day we are alive. 

7. The children can write down how many beats their heart makes in 30 seconds.

**Presentation 2:** The Sun as timer (if possible, go outside on a sunny day in the MORNING to see and trace shadows and then return outside at least two hours later to see and trace the same shadows again)
1. Tell the children there is another timer that we use to measure time, it’s always there and always in the same place – it is the sun. Early humans figured this out a long, long time ago.

2. Remind the children of the lesson of the globe and the dot with the flashlight. Earth turns on its axis so one half of the Earth is in sunlight and the other half is not. The other half of Earth is in shadow. 

3. Tell the children that humans learned to watch the sun and began to measure time by the amount of light and dark in one day. 

4. Humans also learned that shadows during the day were related to time passing and Earth’s movement. You can remind the children the discussion that it appears as though the sun is moving across the sky, but really it is the Earth that is moving around the sun. If outside, search location that have shadows made by trees, objects or by the children themselves. Trace the shadow with white chalk. Tell the children that shadows change in size depending on the sun, on where the sun is in the sky. This is how the early humans learned to tell time and to record time passing.

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/culture/geo/image089.webp" alt="Kid Looking at shadow" >}}

5. Show them the picture of the early sundial. Tell them that humans learned to read the shadows of this stick or pole to tell the time of day.

6. Return back outside a few hours later. Trace again the same object or child’s shadow. It will be SHORTER or SMALLER. This is because the sun is higher up in the sky. Early or late in the day, there are LONG, BIG shadows because the sun is low. When the sun is high, the shadow is smaller. In fact, when the sun is straight overhead, there is no shadow at all. 


**Direct Aims:**
- Introduce the children to the notion of time
- When and how time began
- How time is related to the Earth and sun
- To introduce the children to instruments of measurement for time

**Indirect Aims:**
- Prepare for lesson on the clock and calendar

**Language/ Vocabulary:** pulse; light, shadow, rotation, sundial, timers, measuring time

**Points of Interest:**
* Listening to their heart beat
* Seeing shadows change
* Stories of time

**Control of Error:**
- Design cues: finite timers, times of looking at shadows
- Points of emphasis: passing of sand as way to measure time; size of shadows as way to measure time

**Variations:** 
- Show a watch or clock as a means to record time

**Extensions:**
- Tie lessons on time to lesson in Botany: sprouting seeds, growing seedlings, forcing bulbs and the recording of time passing

### DAYS OF THE WEEK & CALENDAR{.redc}

**Materials:**
* A wall calendar
* Strips of dark paper the same length as the calendar and at least a few inches wide

**Prerequisites:**\
Introduction to time

**Age:** 4 - 6 

**Presentation I:** Days of the week
1. Remind the students of how humans recorded time previously. After humans learned to write and develop language, they started to name each day.

{{< div class="white-outline white-bg w-400 float-right" >}}
Monday - day of the moon (comes after “sun” day)\
Tuesday - named after a god named, Tyr.\
Wednesday - named after the god Woden\
Thursday - named after the god Thor\
Friday - named after the goddess Frig\
Saturday - named after the god Saturn\
Sunday - the day that they worshiped the sun
{{< /div >}}

2. A long time ago humans came up with the idea of counting days by 7s. Each day had a name and there were 7 of them. Also, humans back then believed that many gods ruled what happened on earth because they didn’t understand how earth turned around the sun and made days and nights.

3. Tell the children that they are going to learn by heart the names of the week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

4. Choose a song of the days of the week or a poem and practice it every day for about a week.

5. Invite the children to sing or solo or with a partner.

6. Play games: what comes before Tuesday? After, Friday. Etc.


**Presentation II:**  Calendar 
1. Bring a wall calendar (flip calendar) to the rug with a group of children. 
2. Point to where the days of the week are on the calendar; the ROW across the top
3. Name/ sing/ say the days of the week with the students as you point to them moving across the row.
4. Ask a child to read the last number on the page. Tell them this is the number of days in this month.
5. Using the dark strips of paper, choose a day of the week, for example Wednesday and expose only the column of Wednesdays.  Show them the numbers that are all Wednesdays. 
6. Repeat with other days, covering only one column of days and having them read the numbers and count how many of those days in one month.

7. Give the students a blank calendar of the month with the days written in. Ask them to write in the numbers following the actual calendar.

**NOTE:** there is no expectation that they understand that the months begin on different days, that some have more days than others etc.

{{< img class="white-outline float-right w-400" src="/img/culture/geo/image100.webp" alt="Calendar" >}}

**Direct Aims:**
-  practice the days of the week
- familiarity with how a calendar works
- days (and months) to keep track of time

**Indirect Aim:**  
- Prepare for more calendar lessons
- Prepare for clock work

**Points of Interest:**

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher, other children

**Variations:**
**Extensions:**

### MONTHS & SEASONS OF THE YEAR{.redc}

**Materials:**
Either A. :
- Birthday celebration materials that include labels for the months of the year, perhaps a seasons mat (for example, Waseca)

Or B.:
Labels for the months of the year and for the seasons of the year. Seasons are often best mounted on colors:
* Summer – yellow
* Winter – white
* Fall – orange
* Spring – pink or blue

**Prerequisites:**
* Birthday celebration
* Day and night
* Solar system

**Age:** 4 - 6

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite a group of children to the lesson. Thank them for coming. You can share that the lesson is going to talk a little about birthdays! 

2. Bring the months of the year and the seasons mat to the rug.


3. Ask a child to lay out the months as we do for a birthday celebration. Using the candle is not necessary. 

4. Begin with January and read and say the names of the months of the year with the children. IF there are readers in the group, encourage them to try to read the first few letters which will help them remember the order of the months. 

5. Ask the children to remind each other which is their birthday month. Acknowledge  of these months by pointing to the word or asking the child to pick up the month label.

6. If using a seasons mat: point out the months that are in the seasons: winter, spring, summer and fall. If there are not labels for these months, write the names of the months and put them next to or on the image of the season.

7. If not using a season’s mat, lay out the four season labels at the top of the mat. Then beginning with January, ask the children which season the month of January belongs. Place January under the Winter label. Continue with each month until all are divided up among the season labels. You may discuss that which months occur during which month depends on the geographical location. In many places, “winter” looks different; for example, Florida has a winter, but it is looks and feels very diferent from a MN or WI winter and their winter is shorter, making March already in the Spring season as opposed to northern states of the US. 

8. Pick up all the months and play a guessing game with the students. Say, “I am thinking of a month in the seasons of winter in the state of WI that is very cold with a lot of snow.” Of course, there can be several different answers – all are acceptable. The description can be more detailed to hint even more at the exact month they are trying to guess such as, ”I am thinking of a month that comes early in spring in WI; it is the first month of spring in our region: April. 

9. Invite the children to play this game and also in reverse; name a month or two and have the partner identify which season it is. 

10. Invite the children to write the names of the months using a guided printed version (a dotted font for example). This can be put in a language copybook or portfolio if this is in use. 

11. Invite the children to do another season work such as the card sorting work of clothes we wear in each season; or toys we play with during various seasons. 


**Direct Aim:**
- Familiarize the students with the names and seasons of the year
- Familiarize the students with the sequence of the months of the year and to which season the months belong in their region

**Indirect Aim:**
- Prepare and/or practice of writing the date
- Preparation for elementary calendar work that is more specific

{{< img class="white-outline float-right pure-img" src="/img/culture/geo/image102.webp" alt="Photo Calendar" >}}

**Points of Interest:**
- The connection to the birthday celebration 

**Control of Error:**
- Teacher, other children

**Variations:**
* Use a wall calendar to teach the months of the year
* Do as a group lesson using a classroom display/ interactive calendar with weather, days, months etc.
