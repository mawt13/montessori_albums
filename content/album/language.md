This Early Childhood Language Album is dedicated to all children across the world who struggle with reading. May the adults in their lives be patient with them, may the children be kind to and accepting of themselves, and finally, may both adults and children take advantage of current research to ease the struggle.

## 2. Language Rationale

The Montessori language and literacy materials are vast and offer a multisensorial approach for children to delve into language, reading, and writing development.  The scope and sequence of the lessons is important, and involves focusing first on auditory and oral language development, with lessons that involve teaching new vocabulary and how to have a conversation, followed by lessons involving rhyming, pictures that go together, etc.  The lessons also involve auditory preparation, with the listening for instruments, animal sounds, and beginning and terminal sounds.  The auditory preparation helps prepare students for phonetic hearing and labeling of sounds in words, to encoding, and eventually to decoding.  The language lessons build upon one another and enable the child to progress towards encoding and decoding (reading), and eventually, handwriting as well.  Following the sequence of the Montessori Language and Literacy Album offers a gradual, multisensorial path towards the child becoming a reader and writer.

_Pre-Reading Development_

Long before the child begins to read, development towards reading and writing can (and should) occur.  This includes the simple fact that even as an unborn fetus, the child has already been exposed to language while in utero.  In fact, the child’s brain in utero and for the first three years is growing rapidly. “(M)illions of neurons are developed and mylenized and connections or synapses strengthened or weakened according to the experiences of the child (Grubin, 2002a; Grubin, 2002b).

Neurological studies show that the human brain is uniquely wired for language development.  Brice and Carson point out that, “The basis for all thought, communication, and language occurs in the brain” (Brice and Carson, 4). Various parts of the human brain are responsible for different parts of our language and literacy capabilities: the frontal lobe is associated with expressive oral speech, while the temporal lobe is responsible for our auditory functions as well as our memory.  Within the temporal lobe is the Wernicke’s area as well as the Broca’s area, which is responsible for cognition, speech, and language, and these areas are larger in humans than in animals (Brice and Carson, 4).  Humans are uniquely wired for language and language development. It is estimated that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons (Goswami, 2004) (Brice and Carson, 5).

Physical/gross motor development is linked to children’s pre-reading development.  Prior to being able to read, children should be given opportunities to: cross their midline (through crawling activities such as the brain gym movement called cross crawl), climb, spin, and logroll.  All of these contribute to the development of their brain which needs to occur for success in reading.  In addition, children should be able to track objects from left to right and engage in visual discrimination activities such as working with puzzles and matching pieces of fabric to a corresponding material.  Children should engage in matching objects to other matching objects, and eventually to categories of objects, also while bringing in the auditory component of asking the child to point to the object that starts with “s,” “k,” etc.

Singing songs and engaging children in finger plays and reading books involves playing with language in such a way that children are engaged.  It creates a love for books/songs, and allows children to practice their oral language skills (as well as helps the guide listen for articulation errors, which may be a sign of hearing challenges, auditory discrimination challenges, or other developmental delays which will mean the child needs extra support).  Playing games such as sound lotto, exploring various musical instruments, and playing telephone all support auditory development, an important component of language development and necessary precursor of reading.

Children’s visual system is also important for development towards reading.  Crawling, rolling, climbing, spinning, hanging, and running all support the development of the visual system, and these are activities that perhaps are best engaged in outdoors.   Time to engage in these activities (and direct instruction for some, such as log-rolling) helps prepare the child’s visual system for being able to focus/track left to right and work together.  Children can be taught to trace lazy eights (sideways eights) with their thumb, then even close their eyes and practice making the lazy eight.  Even the grace and courtesy lesson of walking the line helps prepare children’s visual system, as the child looks at the line at first to gauge whether they are walking straight along it.  Various sensorial materials involve visual discrimination and indirectly prepares children for reading, such as the knobbed cylinders, pink tower, and the grading of the color tablets by shade.

Oral language development is fostered through the conversations guides have with the children, and through supplementing the children’s conversation with additional pertinent vocabulary.  Because children are allowed to choose the work they engage in during the work cycle (within various limits), guides are able to support children’s interest and supplement the lessons/work with more sophisticated vocabulary that supports children’s oral language development.  Children engaging in reciting finger plays, poems, and singing songs helps their growth in oral language, and guides can pay particular attention to their articulation and listen for/provide direct instruction in the forty-four sounds of the English language.  Reading (and reciting) poetry also supports children’s oral language development.

In addition, children can be taught to listen for the syllables within words through games in which one taps the syllables (or counts the number of times their chin hits their hand).  Games such as, “Hiccity Piccity Bumblebee, can you say a word with me?  Alligator (said while clapping to the syllables), then changing that word to be different words of a variety of syllables, and even reciting the children’s names to practice counting syllables. After exploration with differentiation of syllables, children can be taught to notice the same onset sounds, focusing first on objects that start with the same sound/same letter, then progressing towards beginning blends, etc., progressing towards recognizing and practicing the same terminal sounds, and eventually including medial sounds.

Children’s oral language development is connected to their reading development/comprehension.  The richer the child’s vocabulary, the more he/she will comprehend what he/she reads…the more language the child is exposed to, the greater the chance of his/her success in reading. The Montessori scope and sequence involves many games that involve playing with language and preparing children to hear/identify objects by their phonemes in language, such as the “I Spy something that begins with ____ “(any letter) (always saying the sound the letter makes).  The object boxes can be used for this game, thus preparing children to hear the auditory sounds of the language.  Eventually, children can listen for all the sounds in the word and break the word down into its various sound components, especially incorporating visual aids like the red-and-blue sided hand mitt that one flips every time one says a sound component of a word.  Then children can work with Elkonin charts, and also with the sandpaper letters, which they trace while saying the sound the letter makes.  These are just the beginning of the Montessori materials that support children’s language learning.

_Montessori Language Materials_

The Montessori language materials are vast and meticulously designed and presented to support children’s language and literacy development. From the left to right, top to bottom progression of materials on shelves to the materials designed specifically for language development, children are supplied with an environment that helps foster the development of language for all children. From the very beginning lessons that guide children in how to have a conversation where individuals alternate between listening and speaking to including a variety of books and stories and reading those to children, the Montessori environment supports children’s language development as well as their listening skills.

Montessori language materials are vast and include the synonym and antonym works, sorting objects by semantic category, preposition games (both with materials and with children’s bodies practicing prepositions).  Children can be taught comparatives through the use of the same objects that differ by proportion/size (such as leaves or pinecones).  Children can match animals and their offspring and practice naming both the adult and the offspring.  Children can play games involving listening for sounds of animals, household sounds, instruments, and listening for a particular word which is said many times in a short story.

The sandpaper letters are an important material in the Montessori classroom, and guides should make a decision regarding cursive first or print first, and all the font in their classroom should match (to the greatest extent possible-it is difficult to have books with cursive instead of printing in the U.S.).  Children are taught the exciting secret code of the sandpaper letters and encouraged to trace the sandpaper letter while saying the sound (offering the multisensorial support for learning the letter sounds).  Children should be taught the sounds of the letters in smaller groups, such as smat, cript, blond, guhf, vewj, kqxyz.  The knock-knock game can be played with groups of letters the children are using, with the guide being careful to keep a written record of which letters the children know by sound.  As children become confident in the sounds of the letters by group, they can be taught blending games with those letters, thus gradually building words with the sandpaper letters, such as at, mat, and sat, and later it, pit, rip, etc.

Another important Montessori material is the moveable alphabet, which is introduced after the child has been introduced to at least one group of sandpaper letters (or after the child is confident regarding all of the sandpaper letters).  The moveable alphabet can be matched to the sandpaper letters, and eventually, the sandpaper letters can be removed so that the child is using only the moveable alphabet.  This transition should be approached with excitement.  The alphabet roll can then be introduced, with the child matching the moveable alphabet to its corresponding place on the roll.  Once the child is confident in this matching, objects can be added that have initial sounds representing the sounds of all of the letters of the alphabet, and the child can also match these to their corresponding place on the alphabet roll.  (The child already would have experienced listening for initial sounds in the previous lessons in the language scope and sequence).

Children can be taught to encode words/build words by various word families with the alphabet roll, such as short a CVC words, short e CVC words, etc.  Alongside this, guides should also help children learn various often used (and non-phonetic) words by heart, such as a, the, she, says, is, he, was.  These can be learned through various memory/matching games and with practice.  This prepares the child for the guide giving dictations which the child then writes with the moveable alphabet, proceeding with short, simple dictations, to more difficult sentences.  Once the child is writing with the moveable alphabet, they can be given their first decoding work with phonetic words written in the same font and colors as the moveable alphabet in the classroom.  As the child unrolls the scroll, he/she should be able to read the word from left to right.  After this, children can be introduced to the phonetic readers of the classroom with much celebration and excitement!  Work with the moveable alphabet should still continue alongside this progression towards reading the phonetic readers (such as the Bob books or Primary Phonics).

All throughout the use of the above materials which supports development in auditory, oral, and language development, children should be engaged in working with materials that indirectly and directly support their handwriting development.  Materials such as the knobbed cylinders (which prepare the child’s pincer grasp) and metal insets, which involve the use of the pincer grasp in grasping the knobs on the inset, as well as writing by tracing the frame and inset, all support the child in developing the necessary skills for handwriting.

_Writing to Reading and Spelling_

The Montessori reading sequence progresses from “writing” (or encoding) to reading and spelling, but only after much work has been done to prepare the child for success and build the necessary skills for first recognizing the various sounds in a word/being able to break a word down into its various sound components as well as associating the sound of each letter.  After children can successfully trace the sandpaper letter and say its sound, they will eventually be ready to blend two letters together to form a word they “write” (encode) with the sandpaper letters.  The first word they can create by blending two sandpaper letters together would be at.  The encoding of words with the sandpaper letters should begin with the child only working with three or four letters in a grouping to build/ “write” words with.  In this, they are also reading the words they have built with their sandpaper letters.

After working with the sandpaper letters, children eventually can progress to encoding words/writing with the moveable alphabet along with their work with the moveable alphabet, to support the transition from the sandpaper letters to the moveable alphabet.  Children can be given groupings of words to encode, thus indirectly teaching word families, such as beginning their work with the “at” family.  The work of encoding prepares children for success in future decoding/reading.  Supports such as control cards can help students flourish with the encoding process, preparing them for progressing toward decoding/reading.

Reading progresses in a simple to complex manner through the use of children writing/building dictations given to them by the guide with the moveable alphabet, reading their dictations, and eventually being given one CVC scroll to unroll and read. All of this prepares children for the exciting introduction of their first book to be read, which the guide will have been careful to prepare the children for utilizing the memorized words by heart and recognition of various CVC words/the ability to read CVC words. Only after the children are reading sight words and CVC words do the guides introduce the variation/exception of the magic e.  After children have worked with these words, CVCV, they will continue to progress in the encoding/decoding process.

Words that are not phonetic, that the child needs to memorize, can be introduced as puzzle words/words by heart, making games with recognizing the words (such as a matching game).  The words by heart are based on the phonetic readers incorporated in the classroom, but include common words such as a, the, I, he, and she.  During this time when children are practicing encoding and learning the sight words by heart, the guide can help them create their own copybook, in which they put the various words they have encoded/practiced encoding.  This can be used by them as a resource in the classroom as well as a record keeping system.

At this point, the child should be ready for short dictations, which the guide presents to the child, who then “writes” the message with the moveable alphabet. The phrases should be short and phonetic, especially at first, and the child is given a control card with which to check their work.  After proficiency with the CVC words and words by heart with the moveable alphabet, exceptions can be introduced, such as the digraphs ch/sh at the beginning of words and ck/ll as terminal letters.  Then, with much excitement, children can be introduced to their first decoding work, which involves tiny scrolls that are unrolled slowly and the child decodes the words on the scroll, which include CVC words that have been worked on in all the previous lessons, as well as the words by heart, and eventually words with digraphs.

After all of these lessons (and after love of the book has been cultivated through various lessons and read-alouds by the guide), the child can be introduced to the first book in the phonetic series, such as Primary Phonics or the Bob Books.  Caution should be practiced to avoid giving the child any book in which there might be even one word they don’t already know.  Therefore, it is good practice to make sure the child has already been able to encode all of the words in the first reader with the moveable alphabet prior to introducing them to their first reader. These phonetic readers should only be introduced when the child will be able to decode/read with success (and confidence)!  Copies of these books can be made which the child can take home to read with their families, and much celebration of their reading should accompany this process.

After all of this work, exceptions can be introduced.  These include the fact that vowels have a short pronunciation (which they have already worked with) as well as a long pronunciation, which they haven’t had as much practice with.  The symbols for this can be taught, and children can learn to read the word based on these symbols.  Later, the magic e is introduced, which makes the vowel become a long vowel.  Following this, children can be given words to decode with the moveable alphabet that change from the CVC pattern to the CVC+magic e pattern, (a-e), such as cub and cube, mat and mate, etc.  The child is then given lessons that allow for more decoding practice, transitioning eventually to learning about the magic e: double ee rule.

_Handwriting and Other Motor Activities_

Along with preparing children for success in reading, the Montessori environment has been indirectly preparing children for success in writing.  From their work with materials such as the knobbed insets, children have already begun to develop the pincer grasp.  The Montessori language materials expand more on that and allow for the child’s fine motor skills to continue to flourish, thus supporting their ability to eventually write what they have already been able to build/encode with the sandpaper letters and moveable alphabet.  The sensorial exploration of the letter with the sandpaper letters and sand tray as well as the tracing first with two fingers, then with only one, helps prepare children for writing.

Another important handwriting lesson includes that of the metal insets, which directly prepares children for writing with the use of the knobs for their pincer grasp, as well as practicing tracing the frame and the inset with a pencil, then filling it in gradually with lines that proceed from left to right.  This work is preparing the child for future handwriting. Working with the metal insets prepares the child’s hand for all the various strokes necessary in cursive and printing, with the curved insets preparing for the curves in cursive, and the straight-edge shapes of the insets preparing the child for printing.  In addition, the child starting their lines at the edge of the frame and ending them at the other edge of the frame, with practicing making the lines as straight as possible, supports their developing fine motor control.

Later, the sand tray can be introduced for children to practice writing letters in, which adds a sensorial dimension to their writing.  In this lesson, the child will transition to using only one finger to write the letter.  This work can aid students with learning differences in their ability to learn the letter: sound associations and is also important preparation for handwriting development, as children sensorially experience the shape of the letter in the sand as well as hear the sound the letter makes as they repeat it to themselves while writing the letter in the sand.

The Montessori materials have been indirectly preparing children for handwriting from the beginning explorations with sensorial materials, such as the knobbed cylinders, which require the use of the pincer grasp, a necessary precursor for handwriting.  Another lesson involves working with the metal insets, which involve the use of the pincer grasp in handling the small knobs on the inset, as well as tracing the frame and the inset with a colored pencil, then filling it in meticulously with lines proceeding from left to right.  This is directly supporting the development of the fine motor skills necessary for writing, as well as the process of writing from left to right.

Alongside their work and exploration with the metal insets, students can be further prepared for writing letters with the use of tracing the sandpaper letters, then writing those letters in a tray of sand.  This also is a multisensorial approach to writing letters in the Montessori classroom, which supports a variety of learners.  With enough practice with these handwriting materials, children will be prepared to transfer these writing skills to writing on paper, and the preparation with regard to phonics will prepare them for phonetic spelling.  Communicating the power of the written message through the guide writing messages to particular students and to the entire class helps provide excitement about writing/motivation, and with all of the preparation of the Montessori lessons and materials, the child is ready for an explosion into writing.  In addition, allowing children to write on vertical surfaces at times (such as a large chalkboard on the wall) provides additional feedback for children as they write.

_CONCLUSION_

When guides follow the scope and sequence of the Montessori language and literacy album, children will be supported in their endeavors to flourish in language, literacy, and handwriting. The various materials and lessons build upon one another to support the child in all aspects of language learning, from the basics of listening and responding in conversation, to the more complex encoding and decoding of text.  The gradual building upon from one lesson to the next ensures that all learners are supported, and the multisensorial approach supports all children in the process of language and literacy development.

### B. EC Language Scope and Sequence: Short & Long versions

**Compiled by Kateri Carver, PhD, Director of UWRF Graduate Montessori TEP**

Following are some basics for teaching phonetic reading with the Montessori method. These are supported by either Montessori’s writings or the years of experiences of translating her process and method from Italian into English, largely by Muriel Dwyer. This was first done in the 1960s in England at the then new Montessori Training Organization-London. Dwyer’s work had had a strong influence on the Montessori method of teaching reading in English. Her method is designed for typically-developing readers, that is, with a base of thorough exposure from birth – 3 of oral language development, music, poetry, and reading. This is, however, not always the case for a variety of reasons such as socio-economic status, parents/caregivers who do not speak English, health issues such ear infections, and finally, emotional trauma. Also, Dwyer’s adaptation into English does not take into consideration the prevalence of reading disorders in English.  Lastly, it is important to realize that learning to read in English is far more complicated than learning to read in Italian as well as many other languages primarily because of the spelling and the fact that English is not as phonetically-based as Italian, Spanish, and many other languages.

_Here are several Montessori ‘basics’ that apply to teaching literacy in English._

* Start with all lowercase letters. We use lowercase to teach sound/ symbol association. Uppercase can be introduced at various times, however, traditionally they are introduced after the child has encountered printed text in books and had been decoding from a page. In other words, unlike traditional education, we do not start with recognizing and/ or writing upper case letters except for a name. This should be capitalized because it is a proper noun and this is indirect preparation for this rule.
*  Call all letters by their sound (noted in this album as /m/ ) versus by their name (as in when we say the alphabet).
* Learn and understand these important terms: ENCODING is to build/’write’ a word with the Moveable Alphabet (hereafter, MA). Many guides use the word “build” when asking the child to “write” a word with the MA such as, “Hakim, would you build the words ‘up the hill’? Then, I will be back to check on you.” DECODING is to break down/ sound out a word already written on a page or in text. We typically show a child to put their finger under the letters from left to right; to begin enunciating all the sounds as they advance their finger pointing to the letter above; then, to put the sounds together, known as blending; finally, to produce the whole word which often involves a recapitulation of all the previous sounds before the word is recognizable to the child. Encoding is a VERY effective way to build good spelling habits, detect red flags for auditory processing issues and/or other literacy issues early on in development and finally, is used BEFORE decoding and ALL THROUGHOUT the learning of both individual symbols (letters) and phonograms as well as digraphs (multiple letters (2-3) that make one sound). 
* Phonograms are successions of orthographic letters that occur with the same phonetic value. That is, for example, two spellings of the same sound: ay & ai : say; may; pay - sail; mail; pail.  Digraphs is a more technical term for the overarching category of phonograms. They are multiple letters making one sound, for example, /ch/. Digraphs can be vowels and/or consonants. Technically a phonogram is a digraph but typically in teaching reading in a Montessori setting, we use the word ‘phonogram’ to refer to all the spelling variations of the long vowel sounds, for example, long a: /ai/, /ay/,/eigh/ and we use the word digraph to refer to the consonant digraphs, for example, /ch/, /th/, /ck/– two consonants that make one sound. The difference is that there are multiple spelling variations for one sound with ‘phonograms’ as in the long a example above. But for the digraphs there are not multiple spelling variations for one sound. There is only one way to write the sound /ch/.

{{< img class="pure-img float-right" src="/img/language/image015.webp" alt="Short Vowel Chart" >}}

* It is important and noted below that when we introduce the first phonogram that we explain with concise language that this is a NEW phenomenon for them. Instead of there being a 1:1 correspondence between the letter and the sound, as in c-a-t  (three letters and three sounds), they have to begin the habit of learning to recognize pairs and groups of letters and that this group (phonogram or digraph) produces one sound. It is no longer a 1:1 correspondence. This new phenomenon is CRITICAL TO EXPLAIN over and over to the children as they learn new phonograms. This album teaches to introduce the first phonogram with /ea/ as long e [meat] which immediately follow /ee/ [meet]. 
* To compound the departure from the 1:1 sound/ symbol pattern used with both the pink and blue SPLs and the short vowel work there is the fact that not only is the new pattern a 1:2 or 1:3 sound / symbol association but there are MULTIPLE ways to make the same 1:2 sound. For example, ay=ai=eigh. We can GREATLY support the child if we explain what is happening. It is typically not obvious to a child to pick up on the pattern since English presents rather complicated spelling patterns that are absent in spoken language. This is classic big-picture teaching which creates an organized mental framework for the learner thereby supporting an otherwise complex spelling system.
*  Learning to see the pairs/ groups of letters and their spelling variations for one sound is why the small MAs are used. By ‘small’, we are referring to printed or card version of the MA that are typically bi-colored; either green/black or red/ blue. The bi-color system trains the eye to detect the patterns within the word. By the time the child moves to the printed, small MA, the pink/ blue (consonant / vowel) association is not as important as seeing the letter groupings that make one sound. 
* Transcriptions for the child of all phonogram and digraph work into booklets or into the child’s copybook are written by the guide and with two colors. The recording process is an entirely different work for the child and requires the ability to write. Therefore, the guide does most of the transcription of the child’s MA work so that it is legible for the child to read and keeps the act of writing separate from reading (encoding and decoding).

{{< img class="pure-img float-right" src="/img/language/image019.webp" alt="Short Long Chart" >}}

* Writing, as in handwriting, is a separate MOTOR skill from the auditory and visual processing of reading. Handwriting can often be developed in parallel to reading but it should not be dependent on, linked to, or in any way connected to the act of encoding or decoding – learning to read. As a motor skill, only the individual can improve it themselves over time with practice. However, as this album addresses in the Handwriting section, for children with suspected or diagnosed reading disorders or delays, handwriting IS A SUPPORT in learning the sound/ symbol association.

* A short sound is made from a single vowel and symbolized with an upward facing curve   
* A long sound is made from 1, 2 or 3 vowels and/ or consonants and is symbolized as a straight line

Note: a long sound can be made from one vowel (often as an initial letter, such as “acorn”) or, from a combination of vowels and sometimes vowels and consonants such as ow (long o)

“Puzzle Words/ Sight Words” 

These are learned by sheer memorization.  We often include words that do follow a rule, but the children have not learned the rule yet however they need to recognize the word, such as be, me, he etc. for early phonetic readers. 

Games, flashcards, a set of flashcards to take home and keep in the car! Children learn to visually recognize these words very quickly. 

There should be a work with the words printed in blue/ pink in large, so they can use them for reference when building sentences with the MA and need to know how to spell a word. This builds the habit of going to a reference.
{{< /div >}}

{{< div >}}
Long vs. Short = name vs. sound: teach them the symbols for these.

Decoding lesson with first few phonograms and with blends such as street, strike etc.
Object box 1: first encoding experience\
⇒ This is an important lesson and should take place BEFORE they are taken to books and very close to their start on printed matter.\
This is the first time they DECODE the word (see letters written on paper and sounded out). The trick to this lesson is to roll up the slips of paper from the END so that when you unroll it, one letter at a time is revealed.
This is exciting and fun for them. Once decoded they place it next to the object. 

You can also write the word and have them decode it and place it next to the object. Object box 1 is for short vowel decoding only. However, they have already encoded with the MA these same words: mat, cat, cup, tub etc…
{{< /div >}}

{{< div >}}
Not a completely separate lesson on the album, but included in lessons as extension from first presentation. Also, material has blends in the level 2 cards. They have not seen the pattern of two pink/ consonants next to each other yet. They can do more graph paper “patterning” of the letters as in the lesson with “dog”. For 5 yr old catching up, blends can also be presented using two colored MAs.
{{< /div >}}

{{< div >}}
Phonetic readers are introduced AFTER some sight words are learned and after first DECODING lesson: Object box 1. 
Titles to use:
Scholastic / Bob books
Primary Phonics 
Creative teaching Press

⇒ Use only phonetic readers at this point that gradually introduce the phonograms. Follow the sequence in the readers as they will likely be leveled and have imbedded review.

Silent ‘e’:
Magic e: introduction: Tell a story about the letter e (optional). If using the kinq/queen/ wizard/ magician story then use a small crown picture or object. 
Materials: Word lists of magic e words for all vowels; paper for booklets ( see lesson). Do ONE vowel at a time, then mix and assess.
1. Magic e with a: mat/mate
2. Magic e with i: bit/ bite
3. Magic e with o: tot/tote
4. Magic e with u: tub/ tube

Object box 1 (if not done) see above or,
Object box 2: same as Object Box 1 but with objects with blends and short vowels to decode: ship, truck; club; lamp 
{{< /div >}}

{{< div >}}
Once they have had practice decoding with object boxes 1 and 2 they are ready to use books more and more.
{{< /div >}}

{{< div >}}
Sight words are continued all throughout the third year in the classroom.
They can practice them with handwriting, build them with the MA and play bingo with the sight words. But no spelling tests! However, at first, we simply provide multiple copies of the printed sight words (on heart shaped paper if using words by heart [WBH] motif) and available on the shelf and in the MA.
{{< /div >}}

{{< div >}}
Double ee: The children usually generalize the rule and assume that magic with e is the same. This is the time to being to introduce them to exceptions and anomalies in English. We present the double ee rule. 
Note: we can teach them at this time to take out several of the letters and make a column.\
ee\
ee\
ee\
Then, they write the words:\
bee\
see\
lee\
tree\
If they have done some blends they can write more double ee words. ( tr, cr, fr)

First Phonogram: ea  
THIS is an important step because it is the FIRST occasion that they come across TWO different letter combinations (ee and ea) that make the same sound AND two letters that make one sound. This concept must be explained clearly;  two or three letters making ONE sound and then, another combination of letters making the same sound! This is why English is hard to spell. 
meat/ meet; hi/ high; threw/through etc.

Long a: ai : picture / image cards with long a pictures (pail, rail, sail, snail). Adult holds on to colored-coded (pink & blue) word card as well as lists of words for that phonogram in case there is a question of what the image represents. The child should also have on the rug the phonogram header card (or the SPL green phonogram)  and an object for the sound ie : pail. 
- Card at top middle of rug with object.
- Rug turned in vertical position.
- MA where easy for child to access – side, above, below the rug
- Pictures on the left and build words on the right.
- Control cards should be colored coded to help child correct their work. 
- Independent work asap with teacher across the room aware but away.\
⇒  Same for all following lessons: header card/ object/ ; large MA / pics as prompts and color coded control word cards for the child to correct. Booklet can be made following the building of the words with the MA but teacher writes it.

## 4. Oral, Visual & Auditory Development

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/language/image084.webp" alt="Child with Sea Shell">}}

### A. Speech and Language Pathology Sequence for Oral Language Development

Snell, E. K., Hindman, A. H., & Wasik, B. A. (2015) “How can book reading close the word gap? Five key practices from research.” The Reading Teacher. 68(7), 560-571.

{{< img class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/language/image086.webp" alt="Pathology Sequence" style="height:32em;" >}}

1. Define New Words
This first step of the framework is to define new words for students.
Students with special needs often struggle to learn words indirectly and benefit from direct teaching of new vocabulary targets (Pence & Justice, 2016).

2. Discuss New Words (Ask Questions) Engaging in discussion gives the student the opportunity to engage with the word in a meaningful way. This also gives the adult the opportunity to target other goals. 

3. Reread
The authors point out that rereading books gives students additional exposure to target words in meaningful contexts.
Students with delays/disabilities need more exposures to words. The average child needs 15 meaningful exposures for a word to become automatic (Marzano, 2004). Children with language impairment need more exposures (Pence & Justice, 2016).

4. Retell
Retelling supports vocabulary learning because, like rereading, it increases children’s exposure to and use of new words and concepts in a story (Snell, Hindman, & Wasik, 2015). Three studies in this article found that retelling had a significant impact on word learning.

**Category:** kitchen 


{{< spacer >}}


#### Conversation Lesson/ Verbal Modeling

{{< img class="pure-img float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image089.webp" alt="Verbal Modeling">}}

**CC Standard:**

**Prerequisites:** none

**Direct Aim:**  To take turns when talking / speaking and listening to another person. To teach how our speech interactions reflect the structure and freedom of the environment as well as an individual’s need for communication which is both passive and active.

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare them to listen for linguistic context, individual words and sounds

**Vocabulary:** Conversation, my turn, listen without talking

**Age:**  2.5 – 4.5

**Control of Error:**	Teacher or adult who manages the conversation

**Points of Interest:** 	The rock or other beautiful natural object that the child holds when speaking

**Materials:** Rock or other beautiful natural object and a bag/ special cloth sack to keep talking piece hidden and protected.

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson and name the lesson.
2. Show the child where the work belongs on the shelf; Carry it to a quiet place in the classroom. This lesson can be done on the floor, at a table (with table mat), in a reading corner etc. Choose a quiet place without interruptions.
3. Carefully and with anticipation, open the bag and reveal the rock or special object.
4. Name it and invite the child to hold it. Ask for it back and put the bag aside.
5. Tell the child that we are going to learn how to talk and listen to each other. “This is called a conversation. There are just a few rules that we always need to observe for good communication and making sure everybody understands what we are saying. “
6. Here are the rules for a successful conversation:
* When I am talking, I will hold the talking piece.
* When you are talking, you will hold the talking piece.
* When I am talking, you are looking at my eyes and listening attentively. 
* When you are talking, my eyes will be on you, and I will be listening attentively. Would you like to have a conversation? 
7. Make up a conversation such as what you ate for dinner last night. End your turn by asking the child a question on the same topic, “What did you eat for dinner last night?” 
8. Hand them the talking piece and model sitting with hands folded in your lap.
9. Continue the conversation sharing genuine communication. You can remind the child that they should be able to tell you what you said. 
10. Thank the child for coming to the lesson and invite them to invite a friend to have a conversation.  

{{< figure class="pure-img float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image091.webp" alt="Verbal Modeling" caption="Any talking piece can be used in this lesson">}}

**Variations & Extensions:**
* Select a table in the classroom that will be for Conversation only. Select a place for it to be located that is out of the way but close enough to be “supervised.”

#### Sequence Story

{{< figure class="float-right rotate270 preview-300" src="/img/language/image093.webp" alt="Sequence Story" caption="Objects for story about going fishing. Objects: rod, tackle box & fish">}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** none

**Direct Aim:**  Introduce the concept of linear progression of time in language for speaking, reading, and writing. This also introduces the notions of beginning, middle, and end in language for speaking, reading, and writing. 

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for and promote planning and organization skills in speaking and writing. 

**Vocabulary:** first, next, finally/ at the beginning, then, at the end // first, then, next, (after that), last

**Age:**  2.5 - 5

**Control of Error:** Teacher and image clues

**Points of Interest:** Objects or pictures that tell a story with no words. This can be paired with life cycle work of plants, animals and humans.

**Materials:** Objects or cards with sequence stories that have a minimum of three segments (beginning / middle/ end) and up to about six segments.

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to lesson
2. Get the work from the shelf, showing the child where to restore it
3. Random the objects or cards on the rug
4. Tell the child we will first examine the objects/ cards and talk about them and then, we are going to tell a story that involves the objects/cards.
5. Begin to examine the objects/cards. Solicit descriptive words; ask questions about the context such as, “I wonder whose fishing rod this is? I wonder how often they fish.” “I think they must have good bait; look at all the fish they caught.” Relate the object / card to child’s life such as, “Have you ever gone fishing? “ 
6. Examine and ponder about each object/card. Then tell the child, “I think there is a story here!” I think something happened first, then something else and then the end. Using the words, “first”, “next” and “at the end” can help tell the story.
7. Let’s work together to tell a story with the words: “First, next, at the end. “ 
8. After together generating a story, consider adding in, “and then” to the story to elaborate further with more details.
9. Ask the child to make a new story. What happens if we move the objects into a different order? 

{{< figure class="float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image095.webp" alt="Sequence Story" caption="Sequence story with cards: Feeding the homeless">}}

10. Invite the child to draw the stories. We can use a simple graphic organizer with the sequence words where the drawing goes.  Use “first, then, finally“ or other sequential language for telling a story.

**Variations & Extensions:** 
* Choose objects/ cards that can have more “events” added and thus, more sequence language
* Consider making large arrows to show the sequence/ chronology. See below:

#### Picture Story

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** sequence words, conversation lesson

**Direct Aim:**  Demonstrate to the child that their thoughts can be put in words; that words make a sentence and, a series of sentences makes a story.

{{< img class="float-right pure-img" src="/img/language/image104.webp" alt="Picture Story" >}}

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare them for reading; promote successful reading comprehension and creative writing

**Vocabulary:** sequence words, dictate, transcribe, title, author

**Age:**  4-6

**Control of Error:** Teacher or adult giving the lesson

**Points of Interest:** Child chooses the picture

**Materials:** Glue stick, a collection of pictures that spark the imagination (or a picture book such as, 365 days of smiles) primary ruled loose leaf that has a blank upper half.

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Affirm their ability to write a story. Tell them you would like to write down their story for them. 
3. Invite them to choose a picture and glue it on the paper.
4. Invite them to dictate their story and to start with sequence words. (Note: the children will speak faster than the adult can transcribe legibly, but this is the PERFECT opportunity to teach about writing. It takes time to write neatly. We have to hold our next thought/ words until the previous thought is written down. Ask the child to slow down, pause and wait for the writing to catch up.)
5. The teacher transcribes the story that the child dictates. 
6. Read the story to the child. 
7. Ask the child if they have a title.
8. Tell them they are an “author” and that you are going to record their name after the title.
9. Invite the child to draw and color a picture on a new page and then to recount the story to you when it is finished so you can transcribe this story too.

{{< figure class="float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image106.webp" alt="Sequence Story" caption="Use magazine, catalog, or newspaper images because this lesson requires many options and frequent updating" >}}


**Variations & Extensions:** 
*  Combine with lessons on handwriting, practice of the Red-Red Rule (Capital-Period), copying, puzzle words where the child writes.
* Coordinate the pictures with themes in Culture or Art area, studying an artist or country / biome.

#### Rhyming Lessons

{{< figure class="blue-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image110.webp" alt="Rhyming Lessons" caption="This work is easier with cards, but it is possible with objects for the introduction Here: nail/pail; box/fox; bat/ cat" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** conversation and listening to read-alouds

**Direct Aim:**  To develop phonological awareness 

**Indirect Aim:**  To assess for reading challenges

**Vocabulary:** Rhyme vs. rime (for teachers)

**Here is a way to remember the distinction:**\
Rimes rhyme but not all rhymes are rimes.

{{< span class="redc" >}}Rimes are word parts that refer to a spelling pattern, and rimes will rhyme.{{< /span >}}\
⇒ Rimes begin with a vowel sound and end before the next vowel SOUND (not a silent vowel)

The bolded letters are the rimes:\
cat bat sat mat or stale male kale
 
⇒ Not all rimes come at the end of a word.

Rhyme can sound the same but be spelled differently, using different rimes: hey may lei

⇒ Just as rhyme and rime sound the same, their different spelling pattern or rime, makes them two different words.

**Age:** 3 +

**Control of Error:** Teacher 

**Points of Interest:** The rhyme- the repetition of the same sound which is often fun! 

**Materials:** Objects that rhyme (boat/goat; mail/pail etc.)

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to lesson 
2. Get the work from the shelf with the child showing them where to restore it
3. Lay out all the rhyming objects in random order.

{{< figure class="yellow-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image112.webp" alt="Rhyming Lessons" caption="Rhyming works with various levels of difficulty are easier to make with cards than with objects. Here using a 6 label Avery template for three words per rhyme. car/ star/barre; cat/hat/rat" >}}

4. Ask the child to choose an object. Name the object and ask the child to place it in the top left compartment in the tray (by pointing to it).
5. Choose the matching rhyme object and say the name. “What was your object?”  “Yours rhymes with mine: Listen, X  & Y.”
6. Continue with the other objects. Say, “they rhyme” after the rhyming words. 
7. Select the first object the child chose and ask if it rhymes with the other objects? Several will not, but at least one will rhyme. “Yes, it rhymes.”

**Variations & Extensions:** 
* Find objects around the room that rhyme
* Have several objects that rhyme, not just pairs.
* Connect this lesson to read aloud poetry

#### Read aloud & Book Nomenclature

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** none

**Direct Aim:**  To expose the child to new sounds, words, and structures of the language through new vocabulary, varied syntax (ie. I took the book; the book, I took) and genres. To engage the child’s imagination and emotions. 

**Indirect Aim:**  To practice listening; improve comprehension, increase concentration 

**Vocabulary:** nomenclature of the parts of the book (pages, spine, cover, title, author, illustrator etc.); names of genres (poetry, tall tale, limerick etc.); quote etc. 

**Age:**  	2.5 +

**Control of Error:** Teacher

**Points of Interest:** Book illustrations; favorite character; hearing a new story	

**Materials:** Story books, anthologies of poetry, short stories, quote books, etc. 	 

**Notes for Reading Aloud to children:**
1. It is helpful for the adult to be on a low chair or bench slightly higher than the children and not sitting on the floor.
2. It is helpful to create read aloud routines & allowances that might be different from regular gathering times, such as lying on their stomachs or choosing a location that is close enough to hear but not sitting on the line; rather, able to spread out.
3. Consider a snack for special occasions when reading or finishing a chapter book. Consider reading a separate chapter book in the afternoon to the 5s/6s. This makes them feel special to follow their own story.
4. Be creative in choosing the reading location: outside under a tree, in a hallway while the class is waiting for something. You can read to them anytime and anywhere! The more frequently, the better and the greater diversity of types of literature the better as well.

**Presentation I:** Nomenclature and Care for a book: Group Lessons/ Gathering time
1. Present to the children the parts of the book; cover, spine, etc.; show how to turn a page of a book and overall, how to care for a book.

{{< figure class="float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image114.webp" alt="Read aloud" caption="The New York Library has 53 million books https://www.atlasobscura.com" >}}

**Variations & Extensions:** 
*  Teach the children about the school and/or public library. Consider showing them pictures, a PPT or even a video of large libraries such as the NY library. Consider visiting a public library or inviting a Book Mobile to your school. Invite a local children’s librarian to come and visit the classroom if you cannot schedule a class trip.
*  Consider bringing in books from your childhood or your favorite stories from childhood.
* When reading to children use P.E.E.R method: 


{{< grid-table class="col-2" >}}

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/language/image116.webp" alt="P.E.E.R. Reading Model" >}}

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/language/image118.webp" alt="P.E.E.R. Reading Model Example" >}}

{{< figure class="red-outline pure-img" src="/img/language/image120.webp" caption="A story about Felix, the lost stuffed bunny who writes letters home during his travels. This is a wonderful language meta-story – it is all about the joy of writing and reading." >}}

{{< figure class="pure-img" src="/img/language/image122.webp" alt="First Language Shelf" caption="First Language Shelf">}}

{{< /grid-table >}}


* Procure anthologies that have a wide variety of poetry, short stories etc.
* Read books that talk about reading, writing and communication such as the Frog and Toad series.
* Use accents, different voices, and other animated embellishments to texts when reading.
* Point out new words, ask if they want an explanation.
* Get in the habit of saying the title and the author(s) when you read a book. Consider the illustrator, too.
* So much more…..

#### Go - Togethers

{{< img class="yellow-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image124.webp" alt="Go-Togethers" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** No specific language lessons; previous card work on a rug

**Direct Aim:**  Develop oral language skills

**Indirect Aim:**  Teach context, prepare for reading comprehension exercises,

**Vocabulary:** Go-togethers, pairs, match

**Age:**  3+

**Control of Error:** Teacher 

**Points of Interest:**  moving from part to whole or whole to part	

**Materials:**  These can be teacher made, but many high-quality options are available for purchase at reasonable prices. Furthermore, the sets available for purchase are often include various types:  go-togethers, antonyms, verbs etc. which are useful for other lessons. See below for one recommended supplier. Cards that have everyday objects that go together such as bike and helmet	 

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Show them where the work should be restored
3. At the rug, place the tray in the lower right of the rug
4. Slowly remove the cards one by one, looking at them carefully and then, begin to place them along the top (L to R) of the mat in rows of about 5 or 6 cards. 
5. Say, I am looking for “go-togethers.” Choose an obvious pair such as bike/helmet pair. Pick up the bike card. Place it under the other rows, on the left side of the rug.
6. Ask aloud, “I wonder what will go with bike?” Use your index finger the trace along the rows (L to R) to name and say the objects as you pass. (This is preparation for finding letters in the MA since the same technique will be used.) 
7. Find the mate and place it to the right of the other card (below the top rows) thereby making a new row of two columns. 
8. Say “ X & Y” go together. Let’s see if we have more go-togethers.
9. Continue until all the cards from the top rows are now in sets in two columns cards.

**Variations & Extensions:** 
* Find objects in the room that go-together  (pencil holder and pencil; brush and dustpan)
* Imagine their home: with them: name some go-togethers
* Use as a group activity by distributing the cards and then, the teacher facilitates the matching process. “I see X, who has something that goes with X?”

“Books are sometimes windows, offering views of worlds that may be real or imagined, familiar or strange. These windows are also sliding glass doors, and readers have only to walk through in imagination to become part of whatever world has been created or recreated by the author. When lighting conditions are just right, however, a window can also be a mirror. Literature transforms human experience and reflects it back to us, and in that reflection, we can see our own lives and experiences as part of a larger human experience. Reading, then, becomes a means of self-affirmation, and readers often seek their mirrors in books.”

― Rudine Sims Bishop

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Show them where the work should be restored
3. Take the work to the rug, place the tray/ basket in the lower right of the rug.
4. Place the cards in stack in the center of the rug. Slowly remove a card and place it below the pile on the rug. Ask the child about the image and to name or recount what they see. If teaching synonyms of verbs, help the child state the verb the same form: gerund ( - ing) or infinitive. For example, “sleeping” or “to sleep.”
5. Tell the child that this work is about finding as many other words that mean the same thing as this card, “sleeping.”  
6. Begin to provide some synonyms for sleeping - snoozing; dozing; dreaming; asleep. Assess if these are words that the child knows already; reinforce if needed. Familiar or not, invite them to repeat the synonyms in a sentence using first person and some gestures. 
7. Move the card to a discard pile and turn the next card over. Choose another and repeat the steps.

**Variations & Extensions:** 
*  Write the synonyms on slips as the child says them! 
* Act out the verbs showing the slight variation of meaning: 
	* think, ponder, reflect, wonder etc.
	* walk, saunter, sashay, stroll, march etc.
* Have synonym sets of cards for verbs; adjectives; nouns 
* Teach regional differences such as pop vs. soda or words from other languages

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** Other card material work in any area of the classroom

**Direct Aim:**  Enrich oral language skills

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for writing; improve reading comprehension

**Vocabulary:** lesson specific 

**Age:**  	4-6

**Control of Error:** Teacher/ Adult

**Points of Interest:** New words

**Materials:** Cards that have concrete nouns or verbs taken from spheres of a child’s life, such as “night” or “walking.”

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Show them where the work should be restored
3. Bring the work to the rug and place the tray in the lower right of the rug.  Lay out the cards across the top of the rug as in the Go-Together lesson.
4. Slowly remove one card and place it in the middle of the rug. Ask the child about the image and to name or recount what they see.
5. Tell the child that we are going to find the opposite of what we see. “This is called an antonym. It is an opposite word.” Model sitting/standing or other body-based opposite actions, such as awake/ asleep. 
6. Tell the child that this work is about finding the matches of opposites. For example: “day” and “night.” Find the opposite card and place it to the right of the first card. Move them up and to left if needed. Place the next card under the left card of the previous pair.
7. Follow the same procedures for laying out cards as the lesson above, Go-Togethers, steps #5- #9. 

**Variations & Extensions:**
*  Find the synonyms for the opposite pair word. For example, “darkness” could describe the opposite of “day.”
* Act out the opposite actions. 
* Pair this work with writing and / or parts of speech (5/6s) : verb, noun, adjective, prepositions
	* laugh/cry; high/low; in front/ behind

#### Sorting Objects or cards by semantic categories

{{< figure class="blue-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image149.webp" caption="Introduce semantic categories with objects, then move to cards with images.">}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** Sorting work; for example, in the Culture area - living/non-living or in the Sensorial area - soft and hard

**Direct Aim:**  Recognize that words (nouns, verbs, etc.) belong to semantic groups which help to create meaning and context.

**Indirect Aim:**  Help the child know the relationship between context and meaning (as well as interpretation).

**Vocabulary:** Material specific. For example, basket/bin of objects / pictures of vocabulary from various semantic categories such as, home, school, church/temple, park, bedroom, living room, castle, airport, construction site as well as labels for the categories. 
⇒ Remember to use ONE consistent font in the classroom and to be consistent when two fonts are used, print vs. cursive. 

**Age:**  	3+

**Control of Error:** Teacher and Culture area works and resources.

**Points of Interest:** The miniature objects, familiarity with their world, naming of objects

**Materials:** Objects, cards or a large image of nouns from various semantic categories, labels of the categories. 

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Show them where the work should be restored
3. Place the basket/bin to the lower right of the rug
4. Slowly remove a category label card and place it at the top of the rug from L to R. If there are three categories, plan label placement accordingly. Read the label to the child before you put it down. Review what it says if needed after all are placed.
5. Tell the child that we are going to name the object/card and place it according to where it belongs – or “sort objects by their category.” “This is the house category.” 
6. Select an object and show the child. Ask them to name it. If they cannot, supply the word. “This is called an armchair. It belongs in the house category. “Choose another object from a different category. Show the child and repeat as above, eliciting expressive language (speaking/ language production) from the child.  Ask the child to which category it belongs. Invite the child to place it there. 
7. Continue until all the objects are sorted by semantic category.

8. Restore the work to the basket/bin and then, to the shelf.

**Variations & Extensions:** 
* Have categories that are closely related such as the different rooms of the house: kitchen, bedroom, living room, garage etc.
* Write word labels or have labels pre-printed for the objects. 
* Choose interest-driven and detailed, whole page images for older children, such as a medieval castles. 
* Look for patterns in types of words: screwdriver, hammer, plier, stapler

{{< img class="red-outline pure-img" src="/img/language/image151.webp" alt="Sorting Objects">}}

**Source:** Kateri Carver, PhD

Using cards with real, detailed images helps children refine their visual acuity, pay attention to detail, and finally, augment their vocabulary. 


{{< spacer >}}


#### Fields and Professions Vocabulary

{{< figure class="blue-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image153.webp" caption="Nouns and professions" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** Sorting and matching card work in the language area or other areas of the classroom 

**Direct Aim:** Enrich oral language skills

**Indirect Aim:**  Preparation for reading and writing; improvement of reading comprehension

**Vocabulary:** Lesson and material specific

**Age:**  4+

**Control of Error:** Teacher/ adult; could make a control card for pairs of the whole work.

**Points of Interest:** Careers and adult jobs	

**Materials:** basket/ bin of objects and pictures related to the careers; (optional) slips of paper and pencil/marker	 

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Show them where the work should be restored
3. Place the basket/bin to the lower right of the rug
4. Slowly remove an object or card representing a profession.  Say, “This reminds us of a job which can also sometimes be called a profession.” Place the object/ card at the top of the rug on the left. 
5. Say, “People who are in the profession of the arts are called artists.” Depending on the readiness of the child, write the name of the person in the profession on a slip of paper. For young or developmentally young children, give word orally only and play a game that they give it back.
6. Continue with other the fields and profession names. 
7. Young child: gather up all the labels and staple together and give to the child. Optional: Make a title slip that says Professions. Older child (5/6): They can glue the labels in a copybook; they can copy the words, build words with M.A. etc.

{{< img class="blue-outline float-right pure-img" src="/img/language/image155.webp" alt="Fields and Professions Vocabulary">}}

**Variations & Extensions:** 
*  Align the work with themes such as, for Fall/ Autumn on the Art Shelf: Farm/ Farmer’s Market- farmer; Store-merchant/ shopkeeper; Waste Management/refuse collector
* Make professions in groups: - ist/ -er / -t/cian /  etc.

**Source:** Kateri Carver, PhD

Teaching the noun and the profession teaches children how language works. This is indirect preparation for later suffix work 
* piano- pianist
* art – artist
* journal – journalist

(other endings for professions include: -er; -ian etc. ) 


{{< spacer >}}


#### Prepositions

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** Other card material work in any area of the classroom

**Direct Aim:**  Enrich vocabulary; develop precise oral language; improve following directions 

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for reading and writing; improve reading comprehension

**Vocabulary:** Preposition (“pre-position”); on, in, over etc.

**Age:** 4-6

**Control of Error:** Teacher/ Adult

**Points of Interest:** New words; acting out the preposition; pictures of real objects from the class (see Materials:  II).

**Materials:** I: Object and box/ basket; 
II: Cards that have prepositions images on them, such as an image depicting “behind.” Using pictures of the actual classroom is fun and interesting, especially, if something is in an usual place such as a chair under the table.

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Show them where the work should be restored
3. Place the basket/tray in the lower right of the rug
4. Remove the objects from the basket, for example, the box with a ball in it. 
5. Invite the child to name the objects and hold the ball.
6. Ask the child to place the ball IN the box. Affirm or assess the position of the ball. If the child does not know the preposition, then give the position word to them using 1st and 2nd  periods of a 3 period lesson. If the child does know the preposition, then continue making a game of the various positions. 
7. Teach common prepositions - see image above as a game.
8. Have the child tell the teacher/adult the positions in which to put the ball / object.

**Presentation II:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Show them where the work should be restored
3.   Place the basket/tray in the lower right of the rug
4. Remind the child of the lesson of the Preposition lesson (the box and ball work). Review position words if needed.
5. Remove the cards one at a time, lining them up in a row across the middle of the rug
6. Point to the first card. Ask the child to tell you what is happening in the picture. 
7. Continue with all the cards. If the child is a reader, they can check their work on the back of the card.

{{< figure class="red-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image159.webp" caption="This work is often made by the teacher using actual materials in the classroom so student can really identify with the objects. The ball is in the basket.">}}

**Variations & Extensions:**
*  5/6s: make a list of prepositions in their copybook
* Combine this work with copying or handwriting work
* Can do a whole group lesson with a chair or other piece of furniture. It is always fun to stand on the chair!

#### Comparative & Superlative

{{< figure class="float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image161.webp" caption="Comparative and superlative lessons can also be done with the Sensorial materials such as the Pink Tower. This material makes it obvious to demonstrate that the comparative and the superlative are relative. Having a fourth object meets the same goal of teaching that the comparison and the superlative are relative. Here, we had the “biggest”  of three pinecones -- only to bring out a fourth that is even “bigger“ that the other; now it is the” biggest.”" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** category work; Sensorial introductory works (cubes, prisms, cylinders)

**Direct Aim:**  to compare and verbally describe two or more objects using the correct form

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for more regular and irregular adjectival endings

**Vocabulary:** ending; “-er”;  “-est”

**Age:**  	4-6

**Control of Error:** Adult or older child

**Points of Interest:** Same objects in various sizes

**Materials:** At least 3 -4 objects that are the same; can be done with cards, too.

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Show them where the work should be restored
3. Place the basket/tray in the lower right of the rug. 
4. Tell the child that this lesson this is different than other lessons where we look and talk about one thing at a time. We actually need them all together to compare them.
5. Take out the three objects/ pinecones and examine them - pick up, hold, touch etc.
6. Select an object and begin comparing it to the others using comparative language. “This pinecone is smaller than this one.” “This one is even smaller. It is in fact, the smallest.” “This is a small pinecone; this is a smaller pinecone, and this is the smallest pinecone.”
7. Change the objects or add an additional of the same object and show that the label of the comparison is relative. What may have been the largest pinecone is no longer the largest pinecone. Play games and use the 2nd and 3rd period lesson to practice comparative and superlative language.

**Variations & Extensions:**
*  Find in the classroom at least three of the same object in different sizes (Sensorial materials for form, colored pencils, circle drawer from Geometric cabinet etc.)

* Align this lesson with Group Lessons on Auditory discrimination lessons-- car: loud, louder and loudest or clapping: fast, faster and fastest.

* Create card material that teaches irregular superlatives: best/ worst/least/ . See table below.

#### Animals and their Offspring

{{< figure class="yellow-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image165.webp" caption="Farm animals and their young are the most frequently used objects to teach the vocabulary of offspring." >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** Oral language development lessons

**Direct Aim:**  Enrich oral language skills

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for reading, writing, and reading comprehension exercises.

**Vocabulary:** Material specific; for example, farm animals

**Age:**  4+

**Control of Error:** Teacher or older child

**Points of Interest:** Figurines and baby animals

**Materials:** Figurines / miniatures of the offspring

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Show them where the work should be restored
3. Place the basket/tray in the lower right of the rug
4. Tell the child that we are going to learn some new words for animals; but they are special animals. They are all babies. Scientists decided to give animals baby special names and we need to learn them! 
5. Take out an animal, for example, the horse. Ask the child what this adult animal is: a horse.
6. When the mother horse has her baby which is born alive and which nurses like other mammals, we call it a foal.
7. Continue with each animal inserting facts about the animal if you wish. 
8. Play games with the child to learn the names. Optional: apply the learning in ways that connect with other areas of the classroom: handwriting, art, story writing, etc.

**Variations & Extensions:**
*  Using cards (pictures) learn more animal names
* Connect this work to science and life cycle work: for example, sometimes eggs stay on the inside, like horses which are mammals and the baby forms inside the mother. Sometimes, the eggs are on the outside, like chickens which are birds and the baby forms outside of the mother.
* Connect to advanced language work with the farm work, parts of speech etc.

#### Identification of Animal Sounds

{{< img class="float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image169.webp" alt="Farm Animals on Rug">}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** Practice being in large group activities; raising hand; taking turns

**Direct Aim:**  Match a sound with a source

**Indirect Aim:**  Preparation for cause and effect; preparation for letter sounds; encoding, decoding and spelling

**Vocabulary:** Material specific

**Age:**  3+

**Control of Error:**  Teacher/ adult

**Points of Interest:** Listening to a sound played aloud

**Materials:** Mp3 device / phone/ tablet etc… ; http://soundbible.com/  and  cards that match the sounds.

**Presentation I:**
1. At Gathering time, tell the children that you are going to play a fun game for all
2. Tell the children that this is a “Listening” game. We need to listen carefully, and we might want to close our eyes as this helps us hear better.
3. Invite the children to be still and quiet.
4. Unroll a mat/rug in front of your place in the Gathering Circle.
5. Lay out three cards. Invite children to name the images.
6. Invite the children to listen carefully as you play a sound. Play a sample for about 5 seconds. 
7. Remind the children not to call out what it is! Select a child to share their answer. Confirm or deny their response. If they identified the source of the sound incorrectly, ask another child to share or play it again.
8. Continue for all the cards on the rug.

**Variations & Extensions:** 
*  Increase the difficulty: for example, various  sounds within the same species such as, Cetacea (whales): clicks, whistles, and calls
*  Choose unusual and funny sounds: a door closing; a squeaking hinge, etc.
* Work to identifying spoken language: voices (gender of speaker; young/older speaker); fast speech vs. slow speech; gentle vs rough tone

#### Identification of Household Sounds

{{< red-box class="orange-outline float-right w-75" >}}
Children with hearing loss may have trouble understanding and using sentences. They may:

* Understand and use shorter sentences than children with normal hearing.
* Have problems with more complex sentences. They may not use clauses in their sentences. An example of a clause is "When I get home, I will eat dinner." They may use passive voice. An example of this is "The ball was thrown by Mary."
* Have trouble hearing word endings, like -s or -ed. They may not understand or use plural words, like cats. They may not use past tense, like walked. And possessives, like Bob's, can be hard to hear or use.

Many auditory discrimination lessons are given as games, and as collective games at a gathering time. While this is both fun and good practice, in order to detect or confirm suspected hearing or auditory processing concerns, auditory discrimination lessons need to be given either in a small group or individually.

## 5. Phonologic & Phonemic Awareness and Skills

### Intro to Phonologic & Phonemic Awareness

{{< figure class="pure-img orange-outline" src="/img/language/image207.webp" alt="Phonological Awareness Chart" caption="https://www.readingrockets.org/teaching/reading-basics/phonemic" >}}

“Phonological awareness is: both the knowledge of and sensitivity to the phonological structure of words in a language. Phonological awareness involves a sophisticated abilty to notice, think about, or manipulate sound segments in words. It can progress from rhyming to syllable counting; to detecting first, last middle sounds; to segmenting, adding, deleting, and substituting sounds in words.”
Birsh, J. Multisensory Teaching of Basic Language Skills. 
Phonemic Awareness:  The ability to decipher different sounds (phonemes) within words and be conscious of the change of phonemes within a single word. Sometimes these differences are subtle (pin/pen) and sometimes not (pin/fin).  
* Example of phonemic awareness: recognizing which words in a set of words begin with the same sound ("bell, bike, and boy all have /b/ at the beginning").

* Example of phonemic awareness: isolating by ear only and identifying the first, middle or last sound in a word. The sound may not be made from one letter in a written form such as truck, trick, picnic but all are the same sound /k/.
(The initial sound of dog is /d/; the terminal sound of sit is /t/)

* Example of phonemic awareness: combining, or blending the separate sounds in a word to say the word (/m/, /a/, /p/ = map)

* Example of phonemic awareness: breaking apart, or segmenting a word into its separate sounds (up = /u/, /p/)

{{< red-box >}}
The global phonological development taught through the oral language exercises and games as well as the auditory discrimination games found in Section 4 provides a strong foundation for auditory readiness for phonemic awareness exercises. This preliminary work also helps form the habit of playing games related to language and paying attention to sounds within language. 
{{< /red-box >}}

\

{{< red-box  >}}
A phoneme is a distinct, single sound that is used in the speech of a particular language. Phonemes are the smallest units of spoken language, and we combine phonemes to make words.

A phonogram is a visual symbol used to represent a speech sound in writing: t, m, oi, ch, igh, etc. Phonograms are also referred to as graphemes. They may contain only one letter or more than one letter.

**For example:**\
The spoken word "cheek" has three phonemes, which you can hear clearly if you say it aloud and separate it into its sounds: /ch - ē - k/. The sounds, not the symbols that represent them, are the phonemes. And this spoken word is written with two phonograms and consonant: ch, ee, and k.

Similarly, the spoken word "though" has two phonemes, /Th-ō/. When we write this word, encoding its sounds into a visual form, we use the two phonograms th and ough to represent these phonemes.

#### The 44 sounds of English


{{< img class="pure-img orange-outline" src="/img/language/image210.webp" alt="24 Consonant Phonemes" >}}



The English alphabet has 26 letters that are used to make 44 /45 sounds in the language through 72 letter combinations made from 1-4 letters.

According to the Dr. Dehaene, a French cognitive neuroscientist who studies reading through brain imaging, research demonstrates that learning English takes twice the time to learn due to its irregularities as compared to Italian or other regular languages.

#### Voiced and unvoiced sounds & Silent letters in English

{{< img class="float-right " src="/img/language/image214.webp" alt="Silent Letters Chart" >}}


Teaching the voiced and unvoiced letters to children can greatly aid those who have some type of reading disorder or challenges. The essential reason that teaching the awareness of voice and voiceless sounds can support struggling readers is that the students can rely on the physical sensation (by touching their throat) to determine the sound and corresponding letter instead of only using visual perception of the letter and auditory processing of the sound as a means to learn. Students who have reading challenges often have visual and auditory processing challenges, so the tactile method is much more effective. 

Usually, we teach the students the VOICED (those that vibrate the vocal cords) and then the rest are unvoiced. Children with reading challenges may not be able to differentiate /p/ from /b/ by only auditory means. Therefore, teaching them the sound by feeling the vibration of the /b/, helps them know what sound to make when they see a /b/ in the word. 


**Pronunciation of /th/: voiced vs. unvoiced ( ELLs)**\
https://www.gonaturalenglish.com/how-to-pronunce-th-properly-in-english

{{< figure class="float-left " src="/img/language/image216.webp" alt="Unvoiced Voiced Chart" caption="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/57843176440370069" >}}


There are two different TH sounds: the unvoiced  /th/, and the voiced /th/.  When ELL do not know the difference or how to pronounce these two, they replace them with sounds they have in their own language. For example, replace the word “ the” with “da”  or “za”. 

1. Unvoiced /th/
When making a voiceless /th/ sound there is no vibration in the vocal cords because all the sounds are made at the front of the mouth with the tongue between the lips; only the mouth is working. 

Sound production/ articulation: the voiceless /th/ is made by lightly blowing out against teeth and tongue. The tongue should be relaxed and extended out so that it is sitting directly over the lower lip. Blow out and let the air pass through your teeth and tongue. 

Examples of words with unvoiced /th/ : 

* theatre
* thief
* worthwhile
* thunderstorm
* mouth
* teeth 
* bath
* three
* worthwhile
* thank 
* nothing
* myth
* thin
* Thursday
* Underneath
* Ethiopia 
* broth


2. Voiced /th/ :\
When making a voiced/ th/, there is a vibration in the throat because the vocal cords are in action. This explains the term “voiced” and is a reminder that we can actually feel vibration when we put the fingers over the voice box* in the throat area. Additionally, there is a slight “buzz sound” carried through the sound. Make the voiced /th/ sound with the tongue held lightly between your teeth, blow air out, and engage the vocal cords.

*The larynx, or voice box, is located in the neck and performs several important functions in the body. The larynx is involved in swallowing, breathing, and voice production.

Examples of voiced /th/ in words: 
* then
* than 
* those
* worthy
* mother
* father
* farther
* northern
* nevertheless
* breathe

Minimal pairs to practice (The linguistic term “minimal pair” is a close pair when two sounds are similar, like: pen/pin)

Unvoiced /th/ sound: tanks/thanks, torn/thorn, tick/thick, boat/both

Voiced /th/ sound: ten/then, tease/these, toes/those, tan/than

#### International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

http://www.englishpronunciationmadrid.com/consonants/consonants/%CE%B8-d

Unvoiced /th/  =  /θ/ (unvoiced consonant)\
Voiced /th/ = /ð/  (voiced consonant)\
θ / ð

The phoneme /θ/ is very easy for speakers of Peninsular Spanish because it’s the sound included in words such as azul or zapato, but it’s absent in the Spanish spoken in Latin America. The voiced version of this sound, /ð/, doesn’t have such a clear equivalent and tends to cause more trouble. Many Spanish speakers produce it just as a plosive /d/, which is not accurate pronunciation. Learning to pronounce, however, is quite a simple task.

Since both /θ/ and /ð/ are spelled as th, it’s difficult to say for sure when to use one or the other. Although there are no hard and fast rules about that, some very useful guidelines can be given.
Let’s start by listening to these sentences:

 [![Play Music](/img/language/image218.png)](http://www.englishpronunciationmadrid.com/consonants/consonants/%CE%B8-d) Think about this. /θɪŋk/ /ðɪs/\
 [![Play Music](/img/language/image218.png)](http://www.englishpronunciationmadrid.com/consonants/consonants/%CE%B8-d) That’s a thought. /ðæt/ /θɔːt/\
  [![Play Music](/img/language/image218.png)](http://www.englishpronunciationmadrid.com/consonants/consonants/%CE%B8-d) They thank you very much. /ðeɪ/ /θæŋk/\
  [![Play Music](/img/language/image218.png)](http://www.englishpronunciationmadrid.com/consonants/consonants/%CE%B8-d) Breathe a normal breath. /briːð/ /breθ/

* At the beginning of words, th is usually pronounced as /ð/ when it’s a function word (determiner, conjunction, pronoun, etc.). E.g., that, those, them, though. Lexical words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) beginning with th, instead, are normally pronounced with /θ/. E.g., think, thorn, thumb, thorough.
* At the end of words, /ð/is very likely to occur in verbs, very often -but not always- followed by e. E.g., loathe, bathe, breathe, writhe. In nouns, on the other hand, final th is normally realized as /θ/. E.g., truth, flesh, cloth, stealth. This gives rise to interesting pairs: mouth (noun, /maʊθ/) – mouthe (verb /maʊð/).

**Common Types of Learning Disabilities**\
The most common types of specific learning disabilities are those that impact the areas of reading, mathematics, and written expression. They may co-occur with other disorders of attention, language, and behavior, but are distinct in how they impact learning.
Dyslexia is the term associated with specific learning disabilities in reading. Although features of LD in reading vary from person to person, common characteristics include: 
* difficulty with phonemic awareness (the ability to notice, think about, and work with individual sounds in words)  
* phonological processing (detecting and discriminating differences in phonemes or speech sounds) 
* difficulties with word decoding, fluency, rate of reading, rhyming, spelling, vocabulary, comprehension, and written expression 

**Dyslexia** is the most prevalent and well-recognized of the subtypes of specific learning disabilities. 

**Dyscalculia** is the term associated with specific learning disabilities in math. Although features of LD in math vary from person to person, common characteristics include: 

* difficulty with counting, learning number facts, and doing math calculations, difficulty with measurement, telling time, counting money and estimating number quantities
* trouble with mental math and problem-solving strategies

 **Dysgraphia** is the term associated with specific learning disabilities in writing. It is used to capture both the physical act of writing and the quality of written expression. Features of learning disabilities in writing are often seen in individuals who struggle with dyslexia and dyscalculia and will vary from person to person and at different ages and stages of development. Common characteristics include: 
* tight, awkward pencil grip and body position 
* tiring quickly while writing, and avoiding writing or drawing tasks 
* trouble forming letter shapes as well as inconsistent spacing between letters or words 
* difficulty writing or drawing on a line or within margins 
* trouble organizing thoughts on paper
* trouble keeping track of thoughts already written down , difficulty with syntax structure and grammar 
* large gap between written ideas and understanding demonstrated through speech 



**Associated Deficits and Disorders**\
While not designated as specific subtypes of LD, there are a number of areas of information processing that are commonly associated with LD. Weaknesses in the ability to receive, process, associate, retrieve, and express information can often help explain why a person has trouble with learning and performance. The inability to process information efficiently can lead to frustration, low self-esteem, and social withdrawal, and understanding how these areas of weakness impact individuals with LD and ADHD can be beneficial in planning for effective instruction and support. Ongoing research is uncovering the specific nature and impact of these problems. 

**Auditory Processing Deficit** (or Auditory Processing Disorder) is the term used to describe a weakness in the ability to understand and use auditory information. Individuals with these types of difficulties often have trouble with:
auditory discrimination (the ability to notice, compare and distinguish the distinct and separate sounds in words—a skill that is vital for reading) 
* auditory figure-ground discrimination (the ability to pick out important sounds from a noisy background) 
* auditory memory (short-term and long-term abilities to recall information presented orally) 
* auditory sequencing (the ability to understand and recall the order of sounds and words)
* spelling, reading, and written expression 

**Visual Processing Deficit** (or Visual Processing Disorder) is the term used to describe a weakness in the ability to understand and use visual information. Individuals with these types of difficulties often have trouble with: 
* visual discrimination (the ability to notice and compare the features of different items and to distinguish one item from another) 
* visual figure-ground discrimination (the ability to distinguish a shape or printed character from its background)
* visual sequencing (the ability to see and distinguish the order of symbols, words, or images) 
* visual motor processing (using visual feedback to coordinate body movement) 
*  visual memory (the ability to engage in short-term and long-term recall of visual information)
* visual closure (the ability to know what an object is when only parts of it are visible) 
* spatial relationships (the ability to understand how objects are positioned in space) 

**Non-Verbal Learning Disabilities** is the term used to describe the characteristics of individuals who have unique learning and behavioral profiles that may overlap with dyslexia, dyscalculia and dysgraphia but that differ in significant ways. Most notably, these individuals often have strengths in the areas of verbal expression, vocabulary, reading, comprehension, auditory memory, and attention to detail. They have trouble with: 
* math computation and problem solving
* visual-spatial tasks and motor coordination
* reading body language and social cues; seeing the “big picture” in social and academic contexts 

**Executive Functioning Deficits** is the term used to describe weaknesses in the ability to plan, organize, strategize, remember details, and manage time and space efficiently. These are hallmark characteristics in individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and are often seen in those with LD. Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a brain-based disorder that results in significant inattention, hyperactivity, distractibility, or a combination of these characteristics. It is estimated that as many as one-third of those with LD also have ADHD, and like learning disabilities, this disorder is linked both to heredity (genetics) as well as to brain structure and function. Unlike LD, features of this disorder can be attributed to neurochemical imbalances that can be effectively treated with a combination of behavioral and, as needed, pharmacological therapies.

Bear In There\
By Shel Silverstein\
There's a polar bear\
In our Frigidaire-\
He likes it 'cause it's cold in there.\
With his seat in the meat\
And his face in the fish\
And his big hairy paws\
In the buttery dish,\
He's nibbling the noodles,\
He's munching the rice,\
He's slurping the soda,\
He's licking the ice.\
And he lets out a roar\
If you open the door.\
And it gives me a scare\
To know he's in there-\
That polary bear\
In our Fridgitydaire.

Choose one of the methods outlined below to demonstrate the number of syllables (parts of the word). Demonstrate that there are two syllables/ parts in the word.
6. Then, ask them to place two gems next to the picture. 
7. Repeat steps 5-6 with other words: 1, 2 and 3 syllable words. Keep asking the same question: How many parts are in the whole word, “alligator?” There are four parts.
8. If the child is ready, tell them that this “part has a name, and it is called a syllable.”
9. Share with them that some words have many syllables and some have few.
10. Remind them hearing the parts of the word will help them be a great speller in the Elementary years.

*5 Ways to Count Syllables*

**The "Listen Method" Rules**\
Say the word.\
How many times do you hear A, E, I, O, or U as a separate sound?\
This is the number of syllables.

**The "Chin Method" Rules**\
Put your hand under your chin.\
Say the word.\
How many times does your chin touch your hand?\
This is the number of syllables.

**The "Clap Method" Rules**\
Clapping may help you find syllables.\
Say the word.\
Clap each time you hear A, E, I, O, or U as a separate sound.\
The number of claps is the number of syllables.

**The "Robot Speak Method" Rules**\
Make believe you are a robot from the year 2030.\
Say a word as this robot.\
Pay attention to the pauses you make.\
How many parts did you break your word into?

_Example:_\
robot = "ro"  *pause*  "bot"... 2 syllables\
Listen:   [pronouncing robot sound](https://www.howmanysyllables.com/pronounce/english101/robot-speak_robot.mp3)\
This is the number of syllables.

**The "Written Method" Rules**\
Count the number of [vowels](https://www.howmanysyllables.com/english_grammar/syllable_rules/what_is_a_vowel) (A, E, I, O, U) in the word.\
  * Add 1 every time the letter 'y' makes the sound of a vowel (A, E, I, O, U).
  * Subtract 1 for each silent [vowel](https://www.howmanysyllables.com/english_grammar/syllable_rules/what_is_a_vowel) (like the silent 'e' at the end of a word).
  * Subtract 1 for each [diphthong](https://www.howmanysyllables.com/english_grammar/syllable_rules/what_is_a_diphthong) or [triphthong](https://www.howmanysyllables.com/english_grammar/syllable_rules/what_is_a_triphthong) in the word.
  * Diphthong: when 2 vowels make only 1 sound (au, oy, oo)
  * Triphthong: when 3 vowels make only 1 sound (iou)

Does the word end with "le" or "les?" Add 1 only if the letter before the "le" is a [consonant](https://www.howmanysyllables.com/english_grammar/syllable_rules/what_is_a_consonant).\
The number you get is the number of syllables in your word.

#### Onset rimes

{{< figure class="float-right yellow-outline" src="/img/language/image229.webp" caption="Onset rime work: cat/bat/sat/fat/;  car/bar(re)/star/far/czar/tar" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** Auditory discrimination lessons

**Direct Aim:**  To identify onset rimes; the changing onset phoneme- the first letter or blend that precedes the rime.

**Indirect Aim:**  Train the ear for phonemic awareness specifically, 

**Vocabulary:** onset rime
(The onset is the initial consonant or consonant cluster of the word, and the rime is the vowel and consonants that follow it. For example, in the word bat, b- is the onset, and -at is the rime. In swim, sw- is the onset, and -im is the rime.)
→ Remember: weight and rate rhyme but they do not have rimes. 

**Age:**  3+

**Control of Error:**  Adult

**Points of Interest:** Rhyming of a rime

**Materials:**	2 (or 3) objects with rimes; books (such as Dr. Seuss), objects or cards featuring onset rime words 

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Show them where the work should be restored
3. Place the basket/tray in the lower corner on the dominant side of the rug
4. Take out the objects that are a rhyming/riming pair, such as: nail/ pail
5. Remind/ demonstrate to the child what a rhyme is by naming the two objects on the rug that contain a rime: a string of letters with the same sound. 
6. Take out about 4-5 cards and random them about the rug
7. Begin to examine the images and name each one
8. This is ‘car’; ‘jet’; ‘bar’; ‘pet’; net’; ‘tar’; ‘jar’ 
9. I hear the rime /ar/ in many words. Let’s look at what we hear before the /ar/ in this one. Take the car card: : /c/ …. /ar/; Can you tell me about this one? /j/ … /ar/…; /t/…/ar/ ; /st/ …/ar/ etc…
  * The object is to confirm that the child can correctly identify the onset phoneme in a rime scheme.

{{< figure class="float-right orange-outline" src="/img/language/image231.webp" caption="More images for onset rimes: hat/gnat/bat/fat" >}}

**Variations & Extensions:** 
*  Use objects from around the room or in a book
* Ask the child to come up with nonsense onset for a rime
* Pair a kinesthetic activity with the identification of a changing onset such as hand.

**Source:** Kateri Carver, PhD

**Note:** ‘gnat’ is NOT a phonetic word due to the silent /g/ but it does not matter in this lesson because this is an auditory lesson.


{{< spacer >}}


#### I-Spy (sound isolation/ segmenting)

{{< figure class="float-right preview-300 green-outline" src="/img/language/image233.webp" caption="These do not have to be phonetic objects. Many teachers use the objects from the CVC collection of objects but ALL sounds are needed. Start with three objects and then increase." >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** Isolation of words within a sentence; isolation of rimes; isolation of onset

**Direct Aim:**  To identify one particular sound (1st initial; 2nd terminal; 3rd medial) sound of word.

**Indirect Aim:**  To prepare for SPLs and learning the symbol(s) that go with the sound.

**Vocabulary:** Listen to the sound with your ears and look for the object with your eyes

**Age:**  3+

**Control of Error:**  Teacher or adult 

**Points of Interest:** Tiny objects and the search for the item (large or small) in the environment

**Materials:** Many small objects: at least 2-3 for each letter of the alphabet and at least one for each sound; Objects indoors and outdoors are easily used for this game, and they do not have to be tiny objects. For example, on the playground, we could play I Spy with something beginning /sw/, and it could be the swing set. 
For each lesson, choose the objects for the corresponding letter sounds that the child will be learning. Typically, we start with /s/m/a/r/t/. In subsequent I Spy games, always choose vowels and usually some consonants too, to review. Often, teachers have a special bag or box for the selected objects for the I-Spy game.

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite a small group of children to the lesson (game).
2. Bring the selected collection of objects to the rug. 
3. Tell the children that they are going to play a game and we will play this game often!! 
4. Carefully empty the contents of the bag/box into the rug. Then, name the objects while also spreading them apart from each other. 
5. Remind the children that this game involves using their ears and eyes and holding their answer inside!!
6. “The name of this game is I-Spy.” Here are the rules of the game: First, the leader says “I-spy with my little eye, something that begins with … make the sound of the object to be found. For example, “I Spy with my little eye something that begins with /m/.  Mat.  Remember the rule: Keep the answer inside! And there might be more than one answer. Tricky!”
7. “Would you like to play? I will be the leader for this round and then later, it can be your turn to be the leader.”
8. Change the game to be “ I-spy with my little eye, something that ends with /s/  (maps) or …something that has /u/  in it (cups)”.

The importance of this game is to EXPOSE the child to the WHOLE RANGE of the sounds in the language in a game format. Therefore, we play I-spy with all the sounds: long vowels, diphthongs /sh/, /ch/, /ow/. See chart of 44 sounds [here](#the-44-sounds-of-english)

**Variations & Extensions:** 
* Increase the difficulty by asking for terminal or medial sounds
* Increase the repertoire of sounds by adding objects with / sh/ and / ch/ sounds 
* Increase the repertoire of sounds long vowels and other sounds /oy/, /oo/ etc.
* Play the game outside using nature as “objects”

#### Segmenting 

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** I-Spy; sound isolation activities 

**Direct Aim:**  Break a word down into its component parts; isolate the phonemes

{{< figure class="float-right red-outline" src="/img/language/image235.webp" caption="r-a-t (3); b-i-ke (3);r-oa-d (3);c-ar (2);k-ey (2); k-ey-z (3)" >}}

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for encoding, blending, and decoding

**Vocabulary:** Letter sounds; initial sound; a sound game

**Age:**  3+

**Control of Error:**  Teacher/adult	

**Points of Interest:** Taking away 1-2 sound(s); clapping, tapping or rhythm sticks 	

**Materials:** cards with pictures of words with 3 phonemes (rat; road; bike); rhythm sticks, maraca, or shaker

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the children to the lesson. This is often a group game.
2. Bring the basket of pictures to the rug and place in lower corner on the right side
3. Take out one picture (bike) 
4. Clap and say the three sounds /b/ /i//k/
5. Say again the first sound and clap
6. Invite the child to say the second sound
7. Say the last sound.
8. Continue to play all kinds of games using tapping; rhythm sticks etc. and pictures of three phoneme words. 
9. Continue to increase the length of words by bringing in digraphs such as, chick, chip and blends such as tree, dress, stamp

**Variations & Extensions:**
*  Differentiation: MACAR MIT for three phoneme words

**Source:** Kateri Carver, PhD


{{< red-box class="green-outline" src="/img/language/image237.webp" img-class="pure-img center-block" >}}
Mitt with red on one side and blue on the other. The teacher dons the mitt and flips the hand each time a new sound is said in the word. For c-a-t:
C – the mitt has the red side up
A – the mitt has the blue side up
T - the mitt has the red side up
Then the child practices segmentation with the mitt.

{{< /red-box >}}

{{< spacer >}}


#### Elkonin Charts

{{< img class="float-right" src="/img/language/image239.webp" alt="Elkonin Chart" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** I-Spy; sound isolation activities 

**Direct Aim:**  Break a word down into its component parts; isolate the phonemes

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for reading and blending

**Vocabulary:**  sounds; first/ second/ third/ fourth 

**Age:**  3+

**Control of Error:**  Teacher/adult	

**Points of Interest:** Objects & gems	

**Materials:** Objects; cards and gems or tokens

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the children to the lesson. This is best done at a table.
2. Bring the tray to the table; remove the chart, the objects, and gems.  Tell the child, “We are going to be matching the sounds with the gems.  For every sound we hear, we will place a gem here.”
3. Choose a chart and an object. 
4. Explain the chart to the child: this is where the object or picture goes, this is where the gems go; one in each square.  
5. Place the object (fan) in the designated area.
6. Say the word and ask the child to repeat it.
7. Ask the child. “How many sounds do you hear? Can you pick up a gem for each sound?”
8. “Place the gems in the squares but – be sure to say the sound as you place the gem.”
9. /f/ /a/ /n/
10. Do several CVCs. However, other three phoneme words will work as well such as, chip, well, phone, vase, check, goat, etc.
11. If the child is ready, choose a chart with four squares and use more challenging words with blends such as, lamp, truck, street, float

{{< img class="float-left green-outline" src="/img/language/image241.webp" alt="Elkonin Chart 2" >}}

**Variations & Extensions:**
*  Consider making the Elkonin Chart that has the squares for the initial blend separate from the rest of the squares. For sleep – s/l/ _  /ee/p/

* Invite the child to think up a word and match the gems to the sounds.

**Source:** Kateri Carver, PhD

{{< figure class="float-right preview-300 red-outline" src="/img/language/image243.webp" alt="Elkonin Chart 3" caption="Standard Elkonin Chart (usually  phonetic CVCs)" >}}

These are most easily made using Excel. Use word families for children who struggle. For example the “at” family: cat/bat/fat/rat etc..
Or use the standard Elkonin chart for students who can segment but need more practice.

{{< figure class="float-right preview-300 yellow-outline" src="/img/language/image245.webp" alt="Elkonin Chart 3" caption="Using tokens or gems without the chart to segment : cl-u-b" >}}

#### Word Families

Word families are groups of words that have a common pattern or groups of letters with the same sound. For example, the “ain” word family includes brain, chain, gain, pain, rain, and so on. The following list of common word families come from Wylie and Durrell, 1970.

{{< pure_table

#### Sandpaper Letters (SPLs)

{{< red-box class="blue-outline" >}}

**Notes on Sandpaper Letters (SPLs)**
1.	It not recommended to keep all the sandpaper letters in one box. One obvious reason is that this is too heavy, and the children will not help themselves to this work because it is too much too carry.
2.	Break the SPLs into groups of 4-5 letters based on the frequency of occurrence in the language. At least one vowel needs to be introduced in each group.  Typically, we start with the vowel a, followed by i and o, then u and e. The vowel e is the hardest to detect within a word, so it helps to learn this difficult vowel after much practice with the other four. 
3.	Procure sturdy boxes/ bins/containers for the groups of SPLs which also will have a collection of objects. Plan containers ready for much use, easily replaced if needed and convenient to carry to and pick up from a rug. 
4.	Consider two sets of pink/ blue SPLs. If one whole set is broken down into groups and permanently becomes part of the SPL Group works such as the SPL Group 1 work, then this makes make it impossible for another child to do any SPL activity at the same time. The SPLs have so many uses, as well as critical literacy skills built into their design that we want several children using them simultaneously. Therefore, consider having a second set displayed on several low picture shelves in different places around the classroom or all together if space allows, so the children can go and get letters, play fetching games and teachers can have access to them all the time. 

{{< /red-box >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** I-spy and sound isolation

**Direct Aim:** First level: to identify the symbol (letters- consonants & vowels) that corresponds to a single phoneme (sound) – letter & sound association; Second level: to identify the symbols (phonograms and digraphs) that corresponds to a single phoneme (sound) – letter groups & sound association.

{{< figure class="float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image248.webp" alt="Sandpaper Letters" caption="https://www.montessoridaoshi.com" >}}

**Indirect Aim:**  Preparation for Moveable alphabet work

**Vocabulary:** Sandpaper letter; smooth, rough, trace

**Age:**  4

**Control of Error:**  Teacher / Adult	

**Points of Interest:** SPL as “the magic code”  (symbol) for the corresponding sound

**Materials:** SPL (usually grouped by frequency) - consonants and vowels; SPL - phonograms 

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to a low table or regular table
2. Bring three Sandpaper letters to the table
3. Be aware of the first letter. Say the sound. Ask the child to say it. Then, ask the child to go and find something in the classroom that has that sound. 
4. Take the first letter: say its sound, pause. 
5. (For right-handed teacher – adapt for left-handed) Deliberately, raise the left hand and make an “L” with the fingers together and the thumb extended; Slowly lower the hand to the SPL and securely hold the letter in place with the left (subdominant) hand. Then, with the right (dominant) hand, trace with two fingers (1st & 2nd) slowly the textured letter following the standard way to make the letter in print or cursive. Trace it again. Say its sound again. Place the letter at the top of the mat or table near the object. Say the letter and the say the object. 
6. Take the next SPL and repeat the same steps: fetch an object, say the sound; hold the letter with subdominant hand, trace it twice with dominant hand and say its sound again. Place at the top of the mat or table next to the object.
7. Do the same for the final letter. Place at the top of the mat or table with the object.
8. Review with the 2nd period lesson the sounds of the letters starting from the LAST one placed. 
9. Invite the child to say the sound; hold and then trace twice with two fingers; then, say the sound

{{< figure class="float-right" src="/img/language/image250.webp" alt="Sandpaper Letters" caption="D'Nealian" >}}

10. Teach more SPLs if the child is ready
11. Continue with phonogram SPLs\
⇒ The SPLS are presented as though they are the “magic code” for the sound that they have identified for so many times previously in oral and auditory language games with objects large and small, poems, rhymes, songs, finger plays etc.

**Variations & Extensions:**
* Transition to the Sand tray
* Do rubbings with crayon and paper of the SPL
* Pair with SPLS and other objects around the room.

#### Special Notes regarding the SPLS

A.  SPLs should MATCH:
* The Moveable Alphabet (MA)
* The font used to make works for all areas of the classroom
* Handwriting practice works and booklets

B.  How to say the sounds of all vowels and consonants for teaching SPLs
Be careful NOT to add a schwa sound (the schwa sound is somewhat like a short u) to the consonants when teaching the sound. This is as if saying /mu/ instead of /m/ for the sound of the letter m. 
One easy way to avoid this is not to choose a word that has a short /a/ or short /u/ immediately after the initial letter when offering a word for the letter. In fact, avoiding all short vowel words as sample words is best. Rather, choose long vowels words. The words are given orally and the sample word does not have to be a concrete noun as it does with the objects that are paired with the SPLs and the Alphabet Roll nor does the sample word have to be phonetic. For example, we could say ‘phone’ for the letter f.\
/a/  as in initial: apple; medial: cat \
/b/ as in boat \
/c/ as in car (the a that follows here is not pronounced as a short /a/, but rather \
as /ar/ from the ‘r-controlled’ suite of words
/d/ as in diamond\
/e/ as in elephant or bed \
/f/ as in fine\
/g/ as in gate \
/h/ as in hoof \
/i/ as in initial ink or medial pig (note: using iguana or igloo is not recommended as these words are NOT consistently pronounced in the same way; often /i / as long e for these words.\
/j/ as in jail\
/k/ - this letter can be skipped for a longtime unless it is part of child’s name; then teach as same as /c/\
/l/ - like \
/m/ - as in mighty\
/n/ -  as in night\
/o/- as in octopus or cot\
/q/ - same as /c/ or /qu/ as in queen \
/r/ - as in ripe\
/s/ - as in side\
/t/ - as in take\
/u/ - as in up; umbrella\
/v/ -  as in victory\
/w/ - as in wait\
/x/ - SKIP\
/y/- yield; year\
/z/ - zoo; zany

#### Knock, Knock: Sandpaper Letters (SPL) game

{{< figure class="float-right preview-300 blue-outline" src="/img/language/image256.webp" alt="Sandpaper Letters" caption="SPLs turned over: start with three or four at most" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** I Spy and sound isolation games

**Direct Aim:**  To identify one symbol (letter) that corresponds to a single phoneme (sound) – letter:sound-association practice

**Indirect Aim:**  Preparation for Moveable alphabet work

**Vocabulary:** Sandpaper letter; smooth, rough, trace

**Age:**  4

**Control of Error:**  Teacher / Adult	

**Points of Interest:** the changing textures	

**Materials:** SPLs (consonants and vowels) from the first group; then continue with other groups; can be play with SPL of phonograms, too.

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite one or a small group of children to the lesson
2. Tell them, you are going to play a game called, Knock, Knock.
3. Ask if they have heard of this: “Knock, knock, who is there? “
4. Take out three SPLs and turn them face down on the rug
5. Knock on the back of the letter (it is face down on the mat) two - three times as if on a door say “Knock, knock, who is there? “
6. Lift the letter and show the child. The child responds with the sound /m/ . 
7. “Yes, it was /m/ at the door! “
8. “Let see who else is at the door.” Continue with other letters
9. Let the child be the person who knocks and asks, “Who is there?”

{{< /grid-table >}}

**Variations & Extensions:**
* Change the letters 
* Use vowels and consonants
* Use successive sounds such as /c/ a/ /t/ to see if the child hears the word
* Use objects with the SPLs
* Do rubbings of the letters

######## Recording keeping: Sound Books

{{< figure class="float-right yellow-outline" src="/img/language/image264.webp" caption="Sound book basket with work for making the booklet and all the student booklets" >}}

Each child has their own sound book which serves as a record of the sounds they have MASTERED. The page is only added when the child knows the sound-symbol association within 1 second as assessed through fetching games, object-letter matching, Knock, Knock games using the SPLs. These booklets always stay at school, and this is a work that is always on the shelf. The children’s booklets are there all the time so more pages can be added. Children can read their books by themselves, to an adult or to the group. Pages can be pink, blue and green or all white with the letters written in the corresponding color – pink (red), blue and green.

#### Blending

{{< img class="float-left yellow-outline" src="/img/language/image268.webp" alt="Blending Sandpaper Letters" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** I Spy; Knock, Knock

**Direct Aim:**  Join sounds together to make partial or whole words

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for “writing” / encoding with the MA

**Vocabulary:** Sounds of letters

**Age:**  4

**Control of Error:**  Adult

{{< img class="float-right preview-300 yellow-outline" src="/img/language/image270.webp" alt="Blending Sandpaper Letters" >}}

**Points of Interest:** Movement and gliding of letters from far apart to close together.

**Materials:**  SPLs and large (long) rug (a table runner works well for this)

{{< img class="float-left preview-300 yellow-outline" src="/img/language/image272.webp" alt="Blending Sandpaper Letters" >}}

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the rug
2. Bring several letters to the rug including /a/ and /t/ 
3. Play Knock, Knock or review the sounds
4. Tell the child that they are getting a very important lesson! 
5. “We need to be on our hands and knees for this lesson AND on opposite ends of the rug. And we each need a letter.”
6. Give the child one of the letters. 
7. Go to the edge of the rug and place the SPL on the very edge. Whoever has /a/ - says the sound of their letter first. Then, the /t/ person says their sound.  Both the child and teacher begin to slowly slide their letter pushing it with both hands while ‘crawling’ forward towards the other person. Each time we move forward toward the other letter we say the name /a/ …./t/. The two letters come closer and closer and the word “at” emerges. 
8. Ask the child if they heard that word? What does /a//t/ say?
9. Take the letters and push them together making 2-3 letter phonetic words:\
at; mat; map; in; on; up; pat; mit, sat, etc….

**Variations & Extensions:** 
* Differentiation:  Do only word families such as the “at” family 
* Make nonsense words

{{< figure class="yellow-outline pure-img" src="/img/language/image274.webp" alt="Blending Sandpaper Letters" caption="“Writing“ with the SPLs This is an important intermediary step BEFORE introducing the Moveable alphabet. Though there is usually only one SPL of each letter, “write/ build” as many words as possible – even nonsense phonetic words!" >}}


#### Sandpaper Letters: Presentation III: “Writing” with the SPLs

{{< img class="float-left preview-300 yellow-outline" src="/img/language/image276.webp" alt="Blending Sandpaper Letters" >}}

1. Place the vowels and the consonants at the top of the rug in one line. It is suggested to have all the vowels first in the row and then followed by all the consonants because many MAs are intentionally set up this way to highlight the five vowels.
2. Pull down a consonant such as /c/ and a vowel such as /a/ and blend them on the rug.
3. “This sounds like the beginning of a word that I know you know, ‘cat’.” 
4. “What can we bring down to make the word ‘cat’?” “Yes, /t/.”
5. “What other words could we make with “ca..” → cap; can; cam; cal; cab; 
6. Repeat this exercise making many words by changing the beginning, middle, or end.

**Variations; Extensions; Differentiation**
* Make nonsense words! i.e., lan
* Differentiation: coloring of graph paper to show letter shapes and sequences.

{{< img class="float-left white-outline white-bg" src="/img/language/image278.webp" alt="Sandpaper Letters Presentation 3" >}}

{{< img class="float-left white-outline white-bg" src="/img/language/image277.webp" alt="Sandpaper Letters Presentation 3" >}}

* Differentiation: ribbon and SPLs
   * Place a small piece of painter’s tape on the EDGE  (or all the way across the letter) the SPL to show where the line “sits” on the line.
   * With a thin blue grosgrain ribbon or cord, line of the letters ‘on’  the line. In actuality, the ribbon/cord has to be over the top of the letters.

#### Transition from Sandpaper Letters (SPLSs) to Moveable Alphabet (MA)

{{< img class="float-right red-outline" src="/img/language/image279.webp" alt="Sandpaper Letters Transition" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** Works with SPLs in making words (not just identifying the sound) 

**Direct Aim:**  To introduce the MA for building words and all encoding work

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for further Moveable Alphabet work

**Vocabulary:** “write” with the MA; build the word; 

**Age:**  4+

**Control of Error:**  Eye of the child and teacher	

**Points of Interest:** The similarity; the 3D letters; the large box

**Materials:** (Large) Moveable alphabet and SPLs

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Go to the shelf where the MA is stored. 
3. Demonstrate how to pick and carry the MA safely and easily to the work area
4. Show the child where to put the top of the box (under the box)
5. Ask the child to bring SPLs that you request such as a, c, l, m, i, s 
6. Tell the child that you are going to find the match for the SPL in the MA
7. Show the child how to trace along the bottom of the first row starting from left to right. Move finger across bottom of the row and look for sound by repeating the sound you are looking for, /c/. Then, nod your head when you come across the letter. For some letters, you will have to travel the whole length of the row and still you will not find the letter. Simply, shake your head, “No” and press on.
8. When you find the match, stop, nod “yes,” that it is the same. Place the MA letter ON OR BELOW the SPL. 
9. Point out that the letters are the same. Invite the child to trace the MA letter as they have for the SPL. 
10. Build a word with the SPLs and ask the child to do the same with the MA letters.
11. Ask child to get specific letters that you request from the MA to assess their ability to maneuver about the box.

{{< figure class="float-right blue-outline preview-300" src="/img/language/image281.webp" alt="Sandpaper Letters Transition" caption="Like this lesson, which reduces the difficulty and does not present the whole MA, select only a few of the MA letters to match with the SPLs" >}}

**Differentiation**
* IF the MA is too much for the child, simplify the task (= a SPED practice of reducing the difficulty) by removing only the letters needed for the exercise. Put only letters needed for writing the words in the corresponding box.  Use a color-coded Control Chart of letters for the student to first map the letters needed for the exercise.  After mapping the letters, then they begin to build words.
* Offer options to do art activities with the SPLs: rubbings; trace around the letter and then “fill in” the color; take them to the white / black board for drawing/chalking etc.

## 6. Encoding

{{< figure class="blue-outline pure-img" src="/img/language/image283.webp" alt="Encoding" caption="Many students need differentiated instruction when using the Moveable Alphabet. The whole alphabet box can be overwhelming. Here is a sample short /a/ word building work that always uses the same MA letters, the same control chart for letter mapping, and the same objects. Once the differentiated sets are made for each short vowel, they can be used over and over." >}}

{{< img class="float-right blue-outline pure-img" src="/img/language/image285.webp" alt="Encoding" >}}


**A differentiated set includes:**
* 4-5 phonetic objects or image cards
* A control chart that has the EXACT letters of the MA letters needed to build the words. This is most easily done by making a colored photocopy of the actual MA letters adhered with double back tape to a piece of paper in landscape orientation. This way the letter mapping on the control chart is exactly the same in color and size. 
* A tray and clear container/ box for the MA letters (see image in Alphabet roll).

### Moveable Alphabet (MA)

{{< red-box class="white-outline white-bg  float-left font-sm" >}}

**Some considerations for the Moveable Alphabet**

Make an informed decision about print versus cursive; or both.\
Make an effort to have the Moveable Alphabet out every day even if it is the adult who writes a message to the students.\
Make MA work fun, enjoyable and celebrate it.\
Teach the children to be as independent as possible as soon as possible when working with the MA.\
A normally developing child who has had regular oral language development games and exercises as well as audio / visual exercises is usually ready to begin building CVC words with the MA by spring of their 2nd year in the classroom; a 4.5 year old.\
A child who avoids reading and literacy activities probably does so for a reason. The likely reason is that it is difficult - meaning, they may have a learning difference. One in four children have a learning difference and the most common learning differences are in reading and / or related to literacy.

{{< /red-box >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** SPL and sound identification

**Direct Aim:**  Associate the MA with the SPLs

**Indirect Aim:**  Preparation for encoding and dictation

**Vocabulary:** moveable alphabet, vowels

**Age:**  4+

**Control of Error:**  The child’s eye and adult

**Points of Interest:** large box, big work, the urge to “write“ with the MA

**Materials:** The Moveable Alphabet

{{< red-box class="white-outline white-bg w-500 float-right font-sm" >}}

**Notes to consider:**

Consider leaving the top off\
Consider getting a special brush to clean the box or air in spray bottle\
Consider a Plexiglas (clear) top for the MA\
Consider leaving the large MA in one place -on one low table and students go to it to get letters.\
Consider making a “deci-pocket “ for MA letters.\
Consider using rubber bands to hold the letters together\
Consider altering the box so the letters do not move much and can only go in facing the right way.\
Consider a MA that has the box designed to have all the vowels together at the top of the box.\
Consider making clear plastic letters for silent letters such as e in bike, and gh in high etc..

{{< /red-box >}}

**Types of Moveable Alphabets (MA):**
* Large moveable alphabet (wooden, plastic, hardboard)
* Small Movable alphabet (sometimes all one color but available in 2 colors; red/blue; green/black) 
* Printed Moveable alphabet (red and blue)


{{< clear-float >}}

{{< grid-table class="col-2" >}}

{{< red-box class="wd-500 pink-jumbotron" >}}
IF more elementary guides knew why the MA is such a powerful literacy tool, then more would use it to teach reading to non-reading 1st graders.

{{< figure class="yellow-outline" src="/img/language/image294.webp" caption="Be creative about how to keep the letters in place; here adhesive felt pads and rubber bands" >}}

{{< /grid-table >}}



**Presentation I:**
1. Invite one or two children to the lesson 
2. Show the child where the Moveable alphabet is kept. 
3. Ask the child to get several SPLs from the shelf or box.
4. Review the sounds. Then, open the MA and take out the corresponding letters and place them at the top of the rug in a row.
5. Arrange the MA letters so they are in a line and under the row of SPLs.
6. Ask the child if they can help you find matches. Pick up the /a/ MA and place it on the SPL. Then, do the same with the other MA letters each time saying its sound. 
7. Ask the child to close their eyes. Take away all the SPLs. Then open their eyes. Do a three-period lesson to check mastery. 
8. Bring some more SPLs and match them

**Presentation II: Child finds letter from MA box**
1. Choose a SPL. 
2. Tell the child you are going to show how to find a letter in the MA box.
3. Ask the child to place their finger on the bottom edge of the row.  Trace/ Glide the finger along under each letter from left to right. Repeat the sound and as they are repeating, pass the finger under the letter and shake their head “no” if it is not the letter that corresponds to the sound.  
4. Choose another letter and find it in the MA
5. Points out the red / blue or pink and blue pattern for vowels and consonants.
6.  Name the category of the blue letters: vowels.
7. Explain that the 5 vowels are blue. If the child is ready, name the category of “consonants.” The consonants are pink (or red, depending on the MA).


**Presentation III: “Writing” with the MA**
1. Choose SPLs that make a CVC the child knows: mat, kit, hop etc..
2. Review blending and making the word with the SPLs.
3. Now invite the child to find the letters and build the word following the SPLs.
4. Invite the child to write some other words: in; can; pat; map; etc.

**Variations & Extensions:** 
*  Write their name with the moveable alphabet (explain that there are no Capital letters with this MA)

### Alphabet Roll lessons, extensions, and variations

{{< figure class="float-right white-outline" src="/img/language/image300.webp" caption="A clear plastic box works very well for this work" >}}

**Materials:**
* Alphabet roll (usually made with two rolls (a-m & n-z)
* Clear box with one letter of each of the 26 letters
* Box of objects (that can be used for initial, medial and terminal sounds) 
* Two ribbons (red or black grosgrain), the entire length of each roll

1. Letter mapping: have students place the letters on the mat. This can be done in numerous ways.
* Visual discrimination exercise only: child does not need to know name or sound

__This mapping work, as in other areas of the classroom, especially Sensorial, offers practice going from three-dimension to two-dimension. This diagnostic activity with letters can help detect a red flag for visual perception or other processing issues.
Can the child  “see” a letter that is reversed when it is laid out?
Can the child manage more than a few letters?__

* Teacher gives child only certain letters to map and this choice of letters corresponds to:
           * a lesson previously given
           * a group of letters when learning sounds or strokes
           * a vowel lesson
           * differentiating certain letters such as in print: b, d, p 
           * transition from sandpaper letters to the movable alphabet


{{< img class="float-left white-outline preview-300" src="/img/language/image302.webp" alt="Alphabet Roll lessons" >}}

**NOTE:** When letter mapping, it is helpful to layout the letters (as many as needed for the lesson) along the bottom of the mat- underneath the “control letters.” 

2. Use with objects: map the letters and then ask child to place an object below the letter; choose initial, medial or terminal sound. Remember, /x/ sound has rarely an initial sound.

3. Use with Sandpaper Letters: match the SPL with only the letter on the control letter on the roll or with the MA letter on the control on the roll.

4. Voiced versus unvoiced consonants: With ``	cards that have symbols for voiced and unvoiced letters, the child identifies each consonant of the alphabet as to whether it’s voiced or unvoiced. For children with reading disorders this distinction can be one of the few tangible ways for them to match the sound and shape. They feel their throat for the vibration since they cannot otherwise process/“hear”/identify the difference of the sound.

{{< figure class="float-left white-outline preview-300" src="/img/language/image304.webp" caption="Letters and initial sound objects [English] (#2)" >}}

5. Tracing the letter: For either handwriting practice or for a multi-sensory way of associating the sound and symbol. This  tracing is done without using the Movable Alphabet letters, and can be down on the floor or with the Alphabet Roll taped to a wall. Simply trace the letters with the first two fingers as you would on a sandpaper letter. This work has the advantage of providing tactile feedback but instead of it being rough as it is on the sandpaper letters, it is a different sensation. Some children do not respond to the rough touch of the sandpaper. That is why the book Red-Letter Alphabet Book was created: to offer children a soft or alternative tactile experience for tracing letters than rough input. This alphabet roll can be used the same way.

6. **Use with objects in a different language that uses same alphabet**: [Spanish] abeja (bee) for a; balena (whale) for b; canasta (basket) for c etc…Note, if making this alphabet roll for use with other languages, it is advisable to include other sounds for the language such as for Spanish, rr, ll, ñ and ch.

7. Capital letters: Using capital SPLs, the child can associate the mapped letter (include mapping first as part of this activity) with the capital letter. Or use the small card MA (which has capital letters on one side of the card) that is placed underneath the appropriate lower-case letter on the Alphabet Roll.

8. Whisper game (Teacher / Adult supported): the teacher or assistant whispers a sound in a child’s ear and then, the child gets the letter of the sound they heard and places it on top of the letter on the roll. 

9. I-Spy: Instead of using SPLs to match with the letter sound, the child matches the object with the letter on the roll. This provides much kinesthetic input as the child usually has to crawl and move around a bit to locate the letter and place the object under it.

### Addition/ Deletion/ Substitution of letters

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** I-Spy; sound isolation activities; segmenting games

**Direct Aim:**  Awareness and verbal manipulation of the additions/deletions/ substitutions of the component parts of a word; isolate the phonemes

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for reading and blending

**Vocabulary:** Addition; deletion; substitute 

**Age:**  4 +

**Control of Error:**  Teacher/adult	

**Points of Interest:** The missing element and its replacement

**Materials:** Cards with pictures of words that lend themselves to additions/ deletions and substitutions and the MA

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the children to the lesson. If this is for a struggling student, consider working one-on-one with them
2. Bring the basket of pictures to the rug and place in lower right side
3. Next to the image, build the CVC word using the MA with the child, such as ‘cat.’
4. Ask the child to get a /b/ from the MA.
5. Replace the /c/ with a /b/ and read the new word: bat.
6. Remove the cat image and find the picture that goes with the word and place it to the left of the word.
7. Write the word cat again. Replace the /t/ with /p/ and read the word: cap.
8. Find the image that corresponds to the word.
9. Replace the /a/ with  /u/ and read the new word: cup.
10. Find the image that corresponds to the word.
11.  Repeat making new words from previous ones changing the initial, final and medial letters. 

**Variations & Extensions:**
*  Differentiation: practice this individually with the child who struggles and keep the former words on the rug: cat- bat- cap- cup  etc. so they can see all the mutations of the word. Review and read each word to practice deletions and substitutions.

### A. Short Vowels (a through e)


#### Short a

{{< img class="pink-outline pure-img" src="/img/language/image306.webp" alt="Short vowels" >}}

* High quality images: color and realistic 
* Concrete nouns for most short vowels then transition to more abstract images representing for example a verb; “running”
* Turn the rug vertically for dictation work
* Use movement with MA encoding work: have child walk to the adult to get the word and walk back to the rug. This also works working memory and attention.  
⇒ Ultimate goal for all short and long vowel work with the MA: Dictate the word and the child writes the word phonetically reasonably or with full accuracy without the image card. Full accuracy for short vowel is required before moving forward to long vowel spelling variations 

{{< center-quote >}}
**Short vowel word building: a through e separately and mixed review**
{{< /center-quote >}}

{{< figure class="float-right red-outline preview-300" src="/img/language/image308.webp" caption="Elements of MA encoding work: Header card with sound- symbol (s) & object Image cards and colored coded control cards 	Word list for dictating words (or identifying image)  Two levels: intro and increased difficulty" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** Word with SPLs and MA; comfort with MA box or alterative

**Direct Aim:**  encoding

**Indirect Aim:**  Establish productive spelling skills

**Vocabulary:** red level; consonant; vowel, consonant

**Age:**  4

**Control of Error:** Eye and ear of the child and teacher

**Points of Interest:** Working with the MA and doing “reading/writing” work

**Materials:** Header card, object; Image cards, word cards that are color-coded; word list ( for teacher);

**Presentation I:** (most lessons in Language from this point forward will be best done 1:1)
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Bring the short vowel work to the rug: the image cards only and the MA.
3. Turn the rug to a vertical position so the child will build words in a column – like a page.
4. Remove the header card and place it at the top of the rug. Remind the child the sound of the vowel by showing the object. 
5. Name all the images on the cards that have that sound as you lay it down in a column on the left most area of the rug. Start with about 4-6 cards only. 
6. Point to first card, name the object or picture. Then reproduce the word by segmenting the sounds, such as:  /c/ ../a/../t/. 
7. Start looking through the MA for the first sound /c/ by running your finger down the row as done previously when looking for a letter. When the letter is discovered, select the letter, bring it to the rug and place it to the right of the picture. Then proceed to the next letter until the word is built.
8. Move to the next image and build the word with the child. Note: As much as possible, try to leave the child to work on their own. This practice will likely begin after several short vowel lists are written. When the child has built all the words, go and get the control word cards. Give the word cards to the child and ask them to check their work. 
9. When the child has successfully built the words by sounding out the word from the image card, then, recording in the copybook can begin. 

**Differentiation:**
* Materials: Separate box for all the needed letters- no more, no less; Control Chart of letters for a specific set of image cards.  After #4 above, ask the child to use a Control Chart of letters for this work and map all the letters needed for cards 1-5 or so. Then, ask the child to get all the /a/ needed from the Control chart (or from the MA if they do not need a Control chart) and have the child lay the vowels out in a column in the center of the rug. 
* Presentation: Take out the first image card: say the object or action. Place it on the left most edge but aligning with the letters in a column.
* Ask the child to find either in the MA or in the Control Chart of letters for this initial sound of the image on the card. Place the consonant. Then, blend the consonant and the vowel and ask the child to get the final consonant. Place the letter. 

{{< img class="float-right pink-outline preview-300" src="/img/language/image310.webp" alt="Short vowels" >}}

* Dragging the finger under each letter as it is pronounced, say the word slowly. 
* Produce the color-coded label and check for a match. Acknowledge that the child wrote a word, and it matches the label!

NOTE: Alternatively, just lay out the vowels in a column after placing the Header card. Then, ask the child to lay out the pictures and write the words. Have the child self-correct. 

**Presentation II:**
1. Introduce another short vowel, such as i or o.
2. Either:
⇒ lay out the cards and have the child write each word completely OR
⇒ Calling the vowels by sound, ask the child to get 5 /a/ and place them in a column in the middle of the rug. Then, invite the child to get the letters that correspond to the first and last sound of the image. 
3. Check the work with the color-coded control card.

{{< img class="float-left blue-outline preview-300" src="/img/language/image312.webp" alt="Short vowels" >}}

4. Repeat with all short vowels: CVC words
5. Invite the child to try writing phonetic CCVC words: stub; stop; trip

**Presentation III: Mixed Review**
1. Select several image cards from each of the vowel sets of cards (set 1 and/ or Set 2)
2. Lay out the image cards in random order so that all five vowels appear in the rug: bat; hut; trip; club; strip; plug etc… 
3. Invite the child to write these words with the MA
4. Have the child self-correct

**Variations and extensions for Presentations I-III:**
* Create a booklet for the child to read of the words they know
* Have the students practice their writing with some of the words they know
* Have the student do the picture story work of drawing and writing the words

#### Puzzle words: List 1

{{< img class="float-right white-outline preview-300" src="/img/language/image314.webp" alt="Puzzle words List 1" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** SPLs and phonetic CVC word building

**Direct Aim:**  Prepare for reading and writing

**Indirect Aim:**  Build spelling awareness and memorization

**Vocabulary:** “words by heart”; puzzle words

**Age:**  	4/5

**Control of Error:**  Teacher / older child

**Points of Interest:** Heart or puzzle shape

**Materials:** Puzzle or heart shaped cards

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to lesson and tell them that this is a reading work BUT there is NO MA!!” “We are NOT going to write these words with the MA.”
2. Ask the child if they know what it means to “Learn / know something by heart.” For example, their first and last name, their address, their mom’s full name etc..  “This is something you do not need to read.. you have memorized it and if you saw it, you would know exactly what it was. For example, I know my name and I never have to try to read my name. I have what it looks like memorized. My name is a word by heart. 
9.  We are going to learn words by heart today – in fact, 5 Words by Heart (WBH).
10. Lay down the first heart with the word “said” on it. This says “said.” Use the word in a sentence, for example, “I said good night to my dog last night and gave him a kiss.” I said the word dog in that sentence. Do you have a sentence with the word “said?” 
11. Point to “said” and do a three-period lesson game. “Put said on the shelf… “
12. Repeat with another WBH such as “the” and use the three-period lesson: name/show / identify in a game format.

**Meet Dolch – The Father of Sight Words**

While at the University of Illinois, Edward William Dolch, Ph.D. (1889-1961) published a book called Problems in Reading to improve the way reading was taught. Of the thirty-two chapters, one chapter elaborates on obtaining a basic sight word vocabulary. Dolch decided to ascertain which sight words were of the most value. He understood the shortcomings of memorizing a long standard word list, stating, “… such lists contain five hundred words or more, too many to be given drill as a sight vocabulary.”

**Dolch Selected High Frequency Words**
After careful analysis and professional judgment, he derived a list of the most common words, commonly referred to as sight words. The Dolch list includes conjunctions, prepositions, pronouns, adverbs, adjectives and verbs; it includes 220 words. He referred to these words as “tool” or “service” words because they are used in all writing regardless of subject matter.

**Dolch Excluded Nouns**
Dolch intentionally excluded nouns from his sight word list. Most nouns are not universal but rather linked to a particular activity or subject matter. He stated, “If new subject matter is used, new nouns must be used.” Dolch did recognize that some nouns do occur frequently (e.g. thing, man). However, he further states, “… in the case of most nouns the rule applies that they are ‘local’ to a particular activity or interest.” As a result, he provided a separate list of nouns that were pertinent to both young children’s interests and first-grade activities

{{< /red-box >}}

{{< red-box class=" " >}}

Typical first Words by Heart (WBH) include:\
the / I/ a/ she/ says/ said/he/ was/ is 

The contents of the Lists of the WBH is determined by the Phonetic readers that are used in the classroom. At this point in the literacy process, the child is getting close to reading their first Phonetic book which will very likely have at least 1-2 sight words in it.

#### Phonetic readers [ short vowel with Puzzle words]: decoding the words

The child MAY be able to read some phonetic books at this point of literacy development.
However, do NOT abandon using the MA! It is needed well into elementary for learning spelling variations, homonyms, silent letters etc.. which are all common complex in English 

**Control of Error:**  Teacher / Adult

**Points of Interest:** Learning to read; reading from a book

**Materials:** Phonetic Readers 

**Notes on readers:**
1. Do not give a child a book to read if there is ONE word that they do not know. In other words, they MUST have encoded all the words in the book and worked with the WBH numerous times before they encounter them in a full decoding manner, in a book. 
2.  Sets of phonetic readers that are leveled and sequenced for difficulty as well as structured in a manner that presents new sounds and/or spelling variations while ALSO reviewing previously seen words and sounds. 
3. Always keep safe and separate from other books, the original copies of the leveled readers. They are leveled readers and need to be kept as a complete series. Think of a series of phonetic readers as a pink tower- like the tower, they all need to be together, completely and fully all the time as one.  Make photocopies of phonetic readers for the students to take home to practice reading with their families.
→ See full discussion of phonetic readers after phonogram lessons 

**Variations & Extensions:**
* Use paper or e- version of books

#### Magic e lessons: a - u

{{< figure class="blue-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image338.webp" caption="Tell the story of this Queen/ King e" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** CVCs a through e

**Direct Aim:** Teach the rule of the final e in CVCV

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for phonograms

**Vocabulary:** Magic e

**Age:**  5

**Control of Error:**  Teacher

**Points of Interest:** Story of magic e

**Materials:** MA letters, a small paper crown; small papers folded in special way (folded forwarded) with a final flap that flips open (to the right)

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson
2. Remind the children of the short vowel symbol
3. Take the letter e and place it in the center of the rug
4. Tell the story of “queen/ king/magician” of the alphabet: e : place the crown over the e. 
5. The e has power to make other letters “say their name.” 
6. Use the paper and write the CVC word: “mat.”     Then, fold the paper and write the letter e. 
7. Explain that the letter e has the power to make other letters name their name; mat becomes mate.
8. Continue writing special magic e words (CVC words that can turn into another word with a final e) using the paper and the flipped edge.

{{< img class="blue-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image340.webp" alt="Magic e lessons" >}}

List of CVC to Magic e words\
mat – mate\
hat  - hate\
slat – slate\
lit – lite\
sit- site\
cut – cute\
cub – cube\
lob – lobe\
lack – lake\
back – bake\
tack – take

**Variations & Extensions:**
* Tell a different story of why the e makes the previous vowel become long (“ two vowels go walking and the first one does the talking and says its name.”)

{{< figure class="blue-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image342.webp" caption="Make Booklets" >}}

**Presentation II:**
1. Show the child where the Magic E works are kept.
2. Choose a Magic e set and explain the label, for example, “ a-e” : the dash means that there is a letter that goes in between the a and the e. Show the previous examples of the CVC word moving to a CVCV word.
3. Place the header card at the top of the rug

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image344.webp" alt="Magic e lessons" >}}

4. Invite the child to get the several a and several e and to make a column. This is an alternate way of writing/building the words. It is easier at the onset to do it this way. Later the children can write one whole word at a time. Like the dressing frame lesson, during which we repeat over and over the same step moving down the frame, in the same way, we build the words with the single vowel and the silent e. Building the pattern like this, helps them identify it more easily later. 
5. Invite the child to lay the picture cards and write the words.
6. Use the Control card to correct the work.
7. Record the work in the Copybook.

**Presentation III:**
1. Show the child where another Magic E work is kept.
2. Select another Magic e set and have the child write the words
3. Suggested order; a-e; i-e; o-e; u-e; e-e→ ee

Other sounds tower: 5 variations: oo/ ow/ oy

{{< /red-box >}}

Following the charts from the scope and sequence diagrams, we can see that we first introduce short vowels, then long vowel sounds and their various spelling variations and then finally, we introduce another series of sounds that are neither short nor long. This introduction can begin after several long vowel variations have been learned such as for two to three spelling variations long e, long a, long o, long i. These include:

CHART 1: Below are the spelling variations for the long vowel sounds. The darker the shading, the earlier this sound is taught.

{{< grid-table class="center-content" >}}

{{< pure_table
"|long a|long i|long o|long u|long e"
"1&sup3;|a|i|o|U|e"
"2&#8308;|a-e|i-e|o-e|u-e|NONE"
"3|ai|ig / igh|oa|Ue|ee"
"4|ay|y|oe|Ew|ea"
"5|eigh|ie|ow||y"
"6|ea||||ie"
"7|||||ei"
>}}

{{< /grid-table >}}

NOTES:
* Sequence is in the shading: the darker the color, the earlier the sound is taught.
* Create leveled lists and corresponding images for the student to practice “writing/ building” with the MA. See  https://www.spellzone.com for word lists for all these spelling variations. Or use search terms such as “list of long a words with ai.”
* The sequence for presenting the long vowel spelling variations is determined by:
1. Frequency of use or presentation in phonetic reader series employed in the classroom
2. Frequency of appearance in children’s readers and everyday usage 
* Typically, once the child has internalized several long vowel phonograms, they switch to the small/card moveable alphabet. The merit of switching to the small/ card MA for the presentations that are not 100 vowel combinations of long vowel sounds, such as /ow/ - variation for long o), /igh/ - variation for long i) allows the child to see the letter combinations in a highlighted color such as,  {{< span "bluec" >}}l{{< /span>}}{{< span "redc" >}}igh{{< /span >}}{{< span "bluec" >}}t{{< /span >}}, {{< span "bluec" >}}b{{< /span >}}{{< span "redc" >}}ow{{< /span >}}. See lesson “Other Phonograms.”



Depending on the phonetic reading book series and the interest and receptivity of the child, we begin to introduce the other sounds that frequently appear in the language, in children’s readers and in the children’s environments. These include: 

**CHART 2: Additional sounds with their spelling variations:**

{{< pure_table
"oo|Ou|ing|y (cons.)|- ar|ci|Gi|- tion|oi|irregulars"
"|Ow||||ce|Ge|-sion|oy|ough"
"|||||||||aw"
"|||||||||qu"
"|||||||||etc.."
>}}

These sounds are taught using the MA exactly as long vowel phonograms are presented:
* header card
* object with the sound
* image cards and color-coded control cards

Since the child likely has much more decoding experience in the sequence now, they will likely move to reading sooner (as opposed to writing/ building only with the MA) these words in text form than they did with the long vowel spelling variations. 

NOTES:
* Sequence in the shading: the darker the color, the earlier the sound is taught
* Sequence in the direction: generally present from the left (+ frequency) to the right (- frequency)
* Typically, once the child has internalized several long vowel phonograms, they switch to the small/card Moveable Alphabet. Using TWO separate-colored alphabets is very helpful for teaching Chart 2 because many of these new sounds are NOT vowel-only as are most of the long vowel phonograms (exceptions include: ow (long o), igh (long i). Chart 2 sounds are best taught with two MAs of two different colors. This is also indirect preparation for Word Study of roots, prefixes etc.

Sample bookmark:\
We made bookmarks with the “rules“ of the  the short and long vowel spelling variations / patterns. The rationale is: when reading, if you do not know how to pronounce a word, use the bookmark to help sound it out. English has 44 separate sounds and that is a lot to remember!!  Why not have a cue card if that helps you read more and better?

#### Capital (Upper case) Letters

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:**  SPLs in lower case and MA; can be done anytime the child needs a pause from learning a new phonogram.

**Direct Aim:**  Teach the uppercase version of all the letters that the child currently knows

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare him for reading (and writing) proper nouns and the beginning of a sentence.

**Vocabulary:** Upper case; capital; lower case

**Age:**  5-6

**Control of Error:**  Control chart of alphabet with upper and lower-case letters. This is typically inside cover of Copybook. 	

**Points of Interest:** Large letters

**Materials:** Capital SPLs and cards that match upper and lower; SPLs OR alphabet roll

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson. Tell them that just like there are children who are small and adults who are big, letters also come in two sizes: big and small or lower and upper case. Some upper-case letters look closely like the lower-case and some do not!
2. Take the first set of SPLs and lay them out in a row across the rug. These are lower-case. Let’s look at the upper-case letters of these lower-case letters.
3. Take the corresponding capital SPLs stack them in a pile.
4. Pick up a capital/ upper-case letter and find its mate. Talk about the similarities of the two. 
5. Go over the name and the sound of the letter. Remind the child that the name and the sound are the same for BOTH lower- and upper-case.  “We use the word ‘upper case’ or ‘capital’ in front of the letter name when want to indicate that an upper-case letter should be used, such as my name: capital S…tephanie.”
6. Continue to find mates/ matches for the lower- and upper-case letters. Discuss the differences in the two symbols.
7. Continue to refer to the name of letter with the designation: lower case e or Upper case

**Variations & Extensions:** 
* Use the alphabet roll as a means to match upper and lower
* Consider teaching only 5-6 upper case letters at a time
* Do crayon rubbings of the upper case letters; make a booklet of lower and upper case.

Capital letters is one of the tabs in the Copybook system. The first group has 10 tabs and the second group, behind has about an additional six tabs. This is customizable for the child and classroom.

The Copybook is also a recording tool for the student and teacher. Nothing gets pasted or recorded in the copybook until the student has successfully built the words with the MA (except for Puzzle words which simply get recorded and the lists serve as reference).

{{< img class="yellow-outline preview-300 float-right" src="/img/language/image378.webp" alt="Days of the Week Work" >}}

**Materials:** Word cards (colors may have color image but otherwise, these cards only have words)

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson. Remind them that this is a lesson without the MA! So, this is a WBH lesson. 
2. Start with either the days of the week or the colors.  Lay the cards out and reading them as you go along. If laying out the days of the week, point out the word “day” in each weekday. Point out phonetic weekday words, such as Sunday. Also, point out the capital letters. Explain the capital rule for writing the days of the week. 
3. The teacher should record these words in the student Copybook.  
4. The child can make a calendar from the Culture or Math area of the classroom.

**Presentation II:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson. Remind them that this is a lesson without the MA! So, this is a WBH lesson. 
2. Repeat the lesson with colors.
3. The child can use colors to note each color word the teacher/ adult writes

**Presentation III:**
1. Invite the child to the lesson. Remind them that this is a lesson without the MA! So, this is a WBH lesson. 
2. Repeat the lesson with months of the year.

{{< figure class="red-outline preview-300 float-right" src="/img/language/image380.webp" caption="Some children will be ready for the small moveable alphabet earlier than others. If it is used in the elementary, it can be already introduced in early childhood." >}}

**Variations & Extensions:** 
* Teach poems and songs with the days of the week, months of the year etc.

Some children will be ready for non-long vowel phonograms such as -ing as in sweeping or ow, as in cow. There is phonogram tower for these non-long vowel sounds. It is suggested to intersperse easy and useful spelling variations such as, - ing after the child has been introduced to a few long vowel phonograms.  Depending on the child, this can be done with a small card Moveable Alphabet. Also, depending on the child, the teacher can share the rule of doubling the final consonant when the word has one syllable. This also applies to 
-ed; -er and -est.

#### Other phonograms :  long i; long o/ long u; long a (eigh)

{{< figure class="white-border float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image382.webp" caption="Images for – igh  high/ sigh/tight rope /might/tight pants/ sight" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:**  previous phonogram work: ea & long a

**Direct Aim:**  Teach the spelling variations of long i/ long o/ long u/ long a (eigh)

**Indirect Aim:**  increase their range of fluency 

**Vocabulary:** long / short

**Age:**  5-6

**Control of Error:**  Teacher

**Points of Interest:** Spelling variations and Copybook additions

**Materials:** Copybook, MA and image cards for long i/long o/ long u/ long a (eigh); consider starting with the small moveable alphabet

**Presentation I:**
1. Follow the same procedures as with other phonograms:
* Header card
* Object with the sound that also has the spelling variation
* Image and word cards (word cards are colored coded)
* Entry in Copybook 
* Booklets in B/W for practice at a later time
* Lay out in columns: either several sets of the spelling variation first in a column OR the child can write the whole word each time.

**Variations & Extensions:**
* Review the sound and names of the letters in the phonogram “igh”
* SILENT letters: if teaching “igh” then attention will need to be given to the fact that letters are present but do not “say” any sound. Consider clear letters for the lesson.

#### Dictation with phonograms and puzzle words seen thus far

{{< img class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image394.webp" alt="Dictation" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** Previous dictations 

**Direct Aim:**  Solidify the spelling of phonograms and practice sight words

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for creative writing

**Vocabulary:** Dictation, sentence, space 

**Age:**  5-6

**Control of Error:**  Teacher 

**Points of Interest:** Using heart or puzzle shaped words and spaceman/spaceperson as a spacer between words (Figure 2 as yellow dots)

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image396.webp" caption="Figure 2: MA using spacing support" >}}

**Materials:** MA; spacing supports; puzzle words on cards and perhaps, an image of the dictation; clip board, pencil and loose-leaf handwriting slips of paper

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite the child to get the MA, a (lined) rug and recording materials such as a clipboard, writing paper and pencil if the child is ready to record.
2. Show the child the work of dictations. This can be a series of pictures and separate control card.

{{< red-box class="float-left w-250 white-outline p-2 center-block" srcs="/img/language/image398.webp" img-class="pure-img" >}}

Make little cards to go in between the words – a space!  See note below.

{{< /red-box >}}

3. Ask the child if they would like to make up their own dictation or if they would like to choose a pre-made dictation based on an image.

{{< img class="pure-img" src="/img/language/image400.webp" >}}

{{< img class="" src="/img/language/image402.png" >}}

{{< img class="w-300" src="/img/language/image404.webp" >}}
{{< img class="w-300" src="/img/language/image405.webp" >}}

**NOTE:** The child may or may not be ready for the Red-Red Rule which is when we introduce capital letter in the beginning of the sentence and a period at the end of the sentence. (See the Grammar section)
Control cards: 


Control cards can be in various formats and can be suited to various levels of difficulty. Having two levels of control cards for dictation is a good way to support early readers that are struggling and still relying on the colors and/ or patterns for support.
1. Bi-colored and with the puzzle words in red (reminders of Words by Heart - WBH): see above
2. Bi-colored and with the puzzle words following the same format
3. All black letters to mirror a book

* _It is good to lead the child slowly to read in black type face as this prepares them for reading from a printed text, booklet, book or reader. And “unhooking” them from the dependence on the support of color and patterns is needed for the transition to the small card MA_. The two colors in the small MA are for highlighting the new difficulty which are typically NOT long vowel sounds:  oo/ ou/ th/ ph/ oy.  See below lessons on small moveable alphabet.

**Variations & Extensions:** 
* Gather images that have phonetic objects in them that can be paired with sight words from Lists 1-3. For example, On Monday, they drove the van home.

**Points of Interest:** Progression in a series and tracking progress

**Materials:** {{< span class="redc" >}}Chart or clear visible way for child to monitor their own progress{{< /span >}}

It is challenging to find well 
structured phonetic readers. Ideally, we need series of books that enable the child to systematically practice new sounds and reinforce previous ones while also intermixing standard sight words. Because of the push for whole language for many years, these phonetic readers fell out of style and use. However, contemporary theory tells us that the phonetic approach to teaching reading has much better outcomes.

{{< grid-table class="col-2" >}}

{{< figure class="w-300" src="/img/language/image411.webp" caption="Bob Books" >}}

{{< img class="float-right white-outline w-300" src="/img/language/image415.webp" alt="" >}}

3. Modern Curriculum Press:  These are not “modern” – but they are VERY well phonetically structured systematically introducing short vowel, long vowel variations in sequence, clusters, and other new sounds such as /qu/. Known as “Phonics Practice Readers,” they are often available used online or in library sales.

There are other reader series, however, they may not be sequenced to follow the Montessori phonetic approach to introducing the sounds. Contemporary readers typically include more sight words earlier. It is not so much that this is pedagogically problematic from a Montessori sequence point of view, it is rather that Montessori students typically start reading much younger due to MA word- building / encoding work. Therefore, 95 - 100% phonetic books are developmentally more appropriate given their sense of order and willingness to exert high levels of effort for result. Sight words cannot be decoded despite effort and therefore they can derail or discourage a young reader. Contemporary early readers are meant for older children.
Though the child is reading books, continue to BUILD words with the MA!

Since the child likely has much more decoding experience in the sequence now, they will likely move to reading sooner (as opposed to writing/ building only with the MA) these words in text form than they did with the long vowel spelling variations. 

However, it is common for a third-year student whose progression in learning the spelling variations has been developing at good rate and who fully conceptually grasps the transition from 1:1 sound/ symbol to 1: 2 or 3 sound/symbols to transition to the small movable alphabet about 2/3 of the way through CHART 1. 

When they begin to learn spelling variations that use vowel and consonants (ight/ ow etc) using two colored MAs is best.

Traditionally, there were two Moveable alphabets: a large which has color-coded letters cut out and the small one which has color coded cards. Nowadays, the term small moveable alphabet is often a reduced size of the large MA and the “ small/card” alphabet goes by other names.  The small/ card alphabets usually come in sets of two with two different colors; for example, one blue alphabet and one red alphabet. There are typically never small/ card alphabets with PINK letters, only red. This is because the small/card moveable alphabet on cards is used to highlight the spelling variations, therefore, a contrasting color features this. The phonogram can be in RED and the rest of the word in BLUE.\
{{< sp l bluec >}}{{< sp "igh" "redc" >}}{{< sp "t" "bluec" >}}\
{{< sp "w" "bluec" >}}{{< sp "eigh" "redc" >}}\
{{< sp b bluec >}}{{< sp ow redc >}}

However, there are small moveable alphabets on cards that also come in black and red (here red highlights the spelling variation). For example:\
cl{{< sp ew redc >}}\
cr{{< sp ew redc >}}

And, there are small moveable alphabets on cards that are green and black (here green, often the color for phonograms highlights the spelling variation). For example:\
bel{{<sp ow greenc >}}\
l{{< sp ow greenc >}}er

Many times, we will have all three colors of alphabets in the ELEM classroom. For example:\
cr{{< sp y redc >}}\
cr{{< sp ie greenc >}}d 

or to highlight heteronyms, homonyms, homographs and homophones. 😊\
b{{< sp ow redc >}}/ b{{< sp ough redc >}}            b{{< sp ow greenc >}}\
h{{< sp ow redc >}}           	      h{{< sp oe greenc >}}\
cr{{< sp ow redc >}}d                 cr{{< sp ow greenc >}}

There really is not a right or wrong answer to the number of alphabets as long as there are at least TWO different colored small/card alphabets for the 3rd years of a 3-6 classroom and for Elementary 1st& 2nd years. The most important determining factor should be the continuity of use of the small/card alphabets in the primary and elementary classroom. In the Elementary classroom, this ‘building/ writing’ work is often referred to as spelling work. In fact, some guides refer to the small card moveable alphabets as the “spelling boxes” since this is now the focus of much elementary ELA work. 

When two different colored card MA are used, it is often convenient to simply swap the vowels in the boxes and use one box.  However, using two single color boxes is needed when the spelling variation is comprised of BOTH vowel and consonants. This supports not only spelling but work with root words, suffixes etc. such as {{<sp farm bluec >}} {{< sp farm bluec >}}{{< sp er redc >}} {{< sp farm bluec >}}{{< sp ing redc >}}.

### Handwriting: Introduction
The expression “the writing is on the wall” has come to mean the announcement of a telling event. When we read Montessori’s own description in The Montessori Method of her beginnings in the low-income sector of Rome, San Lorenzo, we hear of the stories of overcrowded livings spaces, tenement buildings in ruins and …graffiti.

The children were writing on the walls of the tenements of San Lorenzo.  This was seen by owners as defacing the structure.  However, another way to see it is that the children were ready to write. The universal urge to use the hand to express the mind and its creative spirit is a natural development in human history. First, this creative expression appeared through forms of art found on the walls of caves and then, in symbols developed over many thousands of years and inscribed across many surfaces that range from plants to wax. Humans created writing as another means of communication. Writing is the concretization of oral language and thus, guarantees both the longevity of the message and the extreme diversity of its contents.

The graffiti of the children of San Lorenzo was the announcement of their readiness to write; to express themselves. It is a natural developmental stage that almost all children go through using the most readily available writing utensil and the closest vertical surface.  A child’s ‘graffiti,’ typically on a bedroom or dining room wall done by any writing instrument they can find - a crayon or a marker – signifies the natural urge to write; to express, and to create. Similar to a baby reaching for an object or a toddler cruising alongside furniture, writing, too, is a sensory-motor activity grounded in the full integration/synchronization of the visual and tactile perception systems and the small and large muscles of the hand and arm.

As we saw in visual perception exercises, this discrimination can involve form constancy, figure-ground perception, colors, patterns, contrast, spatial relationships, visual sequential memory etc.  Visual perception information occupies the largest area of the brain, the visual cortex , when compared to other areas that process sensory information.  Handwriting requires the successful integration of the various types of visual perception which then must be transferred and reproduced by the locus of the small motor system, the hand. Handwriting is complicated and motor based. Motor activities are only perfected through repetition and practice by the person themselves. 
Appropriate tools facilitate the practice.  Another Montessori language material, the metal insets, are designed for preparing the hand, arm, and imagination to express in writing and drawing. They allow for the practice of preciseness (which the motor system has not developed yet) and simultaneously promote order, beauty, and progress which in turn nourishes further practice. The metal insets allow the children to draw precise figures which is otherwise impossible for them to do given their little time of practicing these movements. Yet, they recognize order, precision, and beauty and are especially drawn to the Metal Insets for these reasons. This material allows for the joyous cycle of work: the material concretely and spiritually satiates the child’s development.

For normally-developing children, the work of reading is separated from handwriting in the Montessori language sequence. In other words, we remove the slow and often arduous process of bringing the hand under control from the purely visual and cognitive process of assigning meaning to a symbol. Handwriting follows reading. Motor practice using the Metal Insets becomes a form of artistic expression, both engaging and fulfilling to the young child. ‘Graffiti’ is art and early writing.

The separation of reading from writing, so critical to reading development, is found embedded in the Montessori materials themselves. The Moveable Alphabet and the Metal Insets are two completely separate didactic materials. In the Montessori method of reading, we start with symbols and their meaning, not with their reproduction of symbols (letters) by the hand, handwriting.
Very young children are capable of symbolic logic for communication purposes. For example, children learn that a nod means “yes.” This sign represents the concept of affirmation or yes. Likewise, children already at three years old can learn that the symbol c represents the /k/ sound. In many ways, assigning a sound to a symbol is far less abstract then assigning meaning to a nod because there is a visual and auditory perception involved with the sound – symbol association (it is a concrete-sensory association) as opposed to only a visual perception involved with the gesture (nod) and concept association (the nod as affirmation). Therefore, it is common for normally developing children to be ready to learn their letters (symbols) and its sound (auditory association) at a young age, already at three to three and a half. 
Taking advantage of the mathematical mind, we start with the logical framework of one sound and one letter. This 1:1 correspondence between the letters and sounds permeates all early language work with oral language as well as with visual and auditory exercise.  We teach the sound /c/ for example, as associated with one letter, c, and omit the anomalies /k/ & /q/. Thus, we skip exceptions to the 1:1 sound - symbol until the child has mastered many phonograms. Likewise, with the letter x which not only never appears as an initial sound but is not one sound, but rather two sounds: /ks/ as in ‘axe’  and /sh/ as in ‘anxious.’

Within the Montessori 3-6 setting, normally developing children exercise their motor skills needed later for handwriting by using the Metal Insets, first with the frames and then with the insets. All the straight and curved strokes for print and cursive are encompassed in the shapes of the Metal Insets. When the writing process is kept separate from both phonemic awareness activities and word building with the Moveable Alphabet, the slower-to-develop motor skills do not impede the reading process, which, as we have seen, the mathematical mind is ready to comprehend at a young age.

For the atypically developing child however, the use of the hand - both writing and artistic expression - must be integrated into the phonemic awareness and early reading processes in order to obtain successful outcomes. A multi-sensory approach to learning has been proven to support atypical learning. When the atypical brain receives information from various sensory inputs, it has better chances for accurate processing and retention. Therefore, when children have demonstrated deficits or delays in sensory-motor activities, attention, visual and/ or auditory perception, using a multi-sensory approach to reading – that is doing writing at the same time as reading - will likely be the best choice and offer the most support.

Children who need to develop multi-sensory learning need to learn symbol-sound association through motor and kinesthetic avenues in addition to just the visual-auditory. The Sandpaper Letters are already multi-sensory materials because they rely on tactile – visual – auditory senses as well as the motor system to solidify the concept of the 1:1 association of sound and symbol. Children who need hand exercises and motor skill development need activities including a wide variety of tools and surfaces to write and draw. In addition, they need to increase motor strength, refine their grip, apply proper pressure, and control the hand. Much work should be done with the hand before the child attempts to write their first letter.

We use a variety of tools, papers, surfaces to develop the motor coordination of the hand\

The child who struggles with reading and probably writing, especially if already 5 years old, knows that they struggle. In other words, they already have an internal narrative that tells them: others read better; faster, easier. They are likely to have a poor self-image, engage in disruptive behaviors, and finally, to avoid all language works. However, they typically do not avoid motor activities. And, using both gross motor and find motor skills to support reading is helpful and effective. 
Children who struggle with reading and writing should be encouraged to use their hands as much as possible for learning to read, draw, and eventually write.

### Metal insets

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image442.webp" caption="https://www.standrewsmontessori.com/2018/05/15/language-metal-insets" >}}

CC Standard:

**Prerequisites:** lessons on carrying trays, using colored pencils, other practical life or basic art presentations

**Direct Aim:**  Practice fine motor skills of the hand

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for print or cursive handwriting

**Vocabulary:** inset, frame, 

**Age:**  4+

**Control of Error:**  the frame, the inset

**Points of Interest:** precision, accuracy, and beauty

**Materials:** circle frame, two or three pencils	 (and carrying tray if available), metal inset paper (5” x 5”)

**Presentation I:**
1. Go to the shelf where the metal insets are set up and displayed
2. Select the circle frame and show the child how to pick up and carry the metal frame and pencils to the workspace.
3. Lay the materials out on the table so there is adequate space for the hand and arm to work unincumbered and so the utensils are available and orderly.
4. Place the frame on top of the paper and hold it firmly in place with the subdominant hand in an L-shape on the frame as in holding and tracing the sandpaper letters
5. Trace a circle with one color. Start tracing in the 1 o’clock position and trace along the edge to complete the circle. Remove the frame and observe the traced circle. 
6. Set the frame aside and begin to trace straight lines from top to the bottom with a second color. Make the lines spread out with space in between. Draw the lines slowly, methodically with care. Admire the work.
7. Show the child how to restore the work.

{{< figure class="yellow-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image444.webp" caption="To fill in a figure, use stokes that are made close together starting at the top and going to the bottom and/ or also from left to right." >}}

**Presentation II:**
1. Choose two metal frames and three colored pencils.
2. Lay the materials out on the table so there is adequate space for the hand and arm to work unincumbered and so the utensils are available and orderly.
3. Place the frame on top of the paper and hold it firmly in place with the subdominant hand in an L-shape on the frame as in holding and tracing the sandpaper letters
4. Trace the shape of the frame with one color. Remove it from the paper and set it aside. Trace the second frame on top of the first in a different color.
5. Examine the outcome. Choose spaces to fill in with straight- or curved-line strokes.
6. Embellish the artwork and demonstrate satisfaction in beauty and careful hand work.

{{< img class="blue-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/language/image446.webp" alt="Metal insets" >}}

**Presentation III:**
1. Go to the display of the metal insets. Choose one inset and three pencils.
2. Be creative

**Variations & Extensions:**
* Make booklets of inset work
* Name the insets
*  Write the names on a booklet of a sample of each
* Use different colored paper such as pink, blue, or black. 
* Vary the writing implements to include markers, chalks, and special colors to reflect the earth’s changing seasons. For example, in December use black paper and pencil colors such as white, silver and gold to reflect the long period of darkness and the brilliance of the stars on winter nights.

### Sand tray
**Prerequisites:** SPLs (recommended but not required); early Art and PL works that practice self-control, hand coordination and the carrying objects.

**Direct Aim:**  Practice fine motor skills for shaping the letters

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for print or cursive handwriting

**Vocabulary:** sand, couscous, or other mealy material

**Age:**  4+

**Control of Error:**  The eye of the child and teacher

{{< figure class="yellow-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/language/image448.webp" caption="https://www.montessoriservices.com/writing-tray-with-lid" >}}

**Points of Interest:** The touch of the sand, shaking the tray to “clear/remove” the tracing; the faint image of the previously traced letter

**Materials:** Tray with high edges, fine sand or other mealy material that easily moves around and can traced in such as couscous, coffee, etc. A tray with a lid is useful.  Choose 1- 3 SPLs.

**Presentation I:**
1. Go to the shelf where the writing tray is kept. It is a good idea to keep this work at shelf level that is easily accessible by all children since it is used by all ages. If there is not a lid, carrying the sand tray requires good balancing skills. 
2. Give a lesson on how to transport the material to a table and to restore it. If it has a lid, demonstrate where to place the lid when working.
3. Go to the shelf where the SPLs are kept and choose 1-3 SPLs.

{{< img class="red-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/language/image450.webp" alt="Sand tray" >}}

4. Arrange the materials out on the table so there is adequate space for the hand and arm to work.
5. Invite the child to watch you as you demonstrate.
6. Trace the SPL with two fingers. Point out that we use two by holding up two fingers. 
7. Place the pointer finger in the pointing position and pause to show this.
8. Trace the letter with {{< sp "ONE finger" redc >}} in the sand tray.
9. Then, carefully, and slowly, shake the tray so as to “erase’ the letter just formed. Be mindful to leave a faint trace of the letter. Invite the child to trace over the faint trace of the letter. Smile! 
10. Take the SPL letter just used and set it aside. This is often done as turning it over as is done when presenting the SPLs. 
11. Choose another SPL and trace it with two fingers. Then, switch to one finger emphasizing the switch from two fingers to one.

**Variations & Extensions:** 
* Students can use the tray for practice of handwriting strokes (not necessarily whole letters)
* Students can use the tray for learning the sound/ symbol association. For a student with a learning difference, the sand tray may be the means with which they learn the letter or word. 
* Students may need to write whole words to help segment or blend.

### More notes about handwriting in the early childhood Montessori classroom

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image452.webp" caption="Montessori chalkboards with squares and lines" >}}

The classroom needs materials, supplies, and a system for teaching handwriting.  The system needs to match the classroom’s SPLs and MA.  Children can learn to read in print from books and still write in cursive. Or they can read and write in print and/ or cursive. Consistency across the classroom and school is critical. There are several contemporary research studies that show the positive results from learning to write in cursive.  The USA is one of the few places in the world that teaches manuscript (printing) before cursive. Likewise, the USA is one of the only places to skip cursive. Further, the USA is one of the few places NOT to use graph paper to teach children to write, whether print or cursive! Use it. Even children learning to write their characters in Mandarin use quadrants.

{{< img class="white-outline float-left w-250 pure-img" src="/img/language/image454.webp" >}}

The most challenging for the children is the issue of space and placement in relation to a line.


Therefore, make very clear where the children START the letters and what is the area that is designated for the letters that go below the line.

{{< img class="blue-outline w-250" srFc="/img/language/image456.webp" >}}


Practice with the MA on a long rug (as paper) using ribbons for lines and dashes. 

{{< img class="white-outline  float-left" src="/img/language/image458.webp" >}}

Use downloadable free fonts to make handwriting exercises (pages and booklets for practice), works in the classroom, name cards etc. Fonts have lines, arrows, solid or dotted letters and many more options. 

{{< img class="white-outline w-250 float-left" src="/img/language/image460.webp" >}}

Whether teaching children to print or to write in cursive, there are established methods that group together practice of letters with similar strokes. There is no need to re-invent a writing program – only maybe the actual exercises.

Here is a Canadian guide for both cursive and print:

## 9. Grammar

{{< figure class="blue-outline" src="/img/language/image462.webp" caption="https://www.etsy.com/shop/BlueMoonMontessori" >}}


{{< spacer >}}



### The Miniature Environment

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image464.webp" caption="https://www.nienhuis.com/us/en/the-farm-nienhuis-montessori-usa/product/5023" >}}

The miniature environment is used for reading (usually only decoding), grammar (parts of speech), and syntax practice (sentence structure). However, the miniature environment can also be used for oral language development exercises. 
The traditional miniature environment is the farm. However, many classrooms change the mini environments according to oral language needs/interests as well as according to themes of the classroom such as, Community Professions or a biome, as in the African grasslands.
When used as an oral language material or for phonemic awareness development, no grammar materials are used. It is simply used for exploration and discovery with an adult to interact, model language, and demonstrate proper use of the miniature objects. Some suggestions for miniature environments that promote oral language development include:

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image466.webp" caption="Camping set by Playmobile." >}}

* Home (house or apartment) 
* Grocery store 
* Department store 
* School
* Park 
* Ocean (or other natural biomes)
* Hospital 
* Etc.

{{< figure class="white-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/language/image468.webp" caption="Make your own Miniature environments with some fixed and some moveable pieces. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k69siWvoChI" >}}

{{< img class="white-outline w-250 pure-img my-1 center-block" src="/img/language/image470.webp" >}}

\
**Miniature environment for grammar lessons**
* Small light blue pyramid: article
* Medium dark blue pyramid: adjective
* Large black pyramid: noun
* Red Sphere: verb

Before using the miniature environment for teaching grammar and syntax, first there are preliminary grammar lessons need to be given. 
1. Teaching the parts of speech
* Story or game
* Practice with classroom objects
* Command card work
2. Demonstrate the work with the Miniature environment

_Teaching the Parts of Speech_

{{< figure class="white-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/language/image478.webp" caption="www.neinhaus.com" >}}

### Noun Lesson

**Prerequisites:**  Reading with no image support CVC words, several phonograms and least puzzle words: the, an, a. 

**Direct Aim:**  Learn the name of the part of speech, the noun

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for further lesson in grammar and syntax

**Vocabulary:** noun, coal, pyramid, 3D and 2D

**Age:**  5+

**Control of Error:**  Teacher 	

**Points of Interest:** Story of the pyramids

**Materials:** Black pyramid & stand; grammar symbols (in 2D ) box; strips of paper and pencil or nouns printed and mounted on black paper.

{{< figure class="white-outlifne float-left preview-300" src="/img/language/image480.webp" caption="http://whatdidwedoallday.blogspot.com" >}}

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite a small group of elders to the lesson
2. Tell them this is preparation for other first grade and elementary lessons!
3. Tell them the story of How nouns came to be.
There are several versions online. They all use the main image which is the pyramid. The oldest standing buildings, the Egyptian pyramids, remind us of the oldest words. They have been around as long as coal, which is found within the earth and takes many, many years to form, like the age of the pyramids. The color reminds us of coal which is also very old and been on earth a very long time.  There are many stories and naming words hold special significance in many cultures and religions across the world.
Here are some Montessori versions:
* https://montessoricommons.cc/the-story-of-the-naming-word-the-noun/
* http://helpfromdebbie.blogspot.com/2012/10/first-impression-montessori-grammar.html
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QArazCB_sXQ
4. Show them the 2D symbol version of the 3D pyramid. “This triangle reminds us of the pyramid.”
{{< figure class="white-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/language/image482.webp" caption="https://www.blog.montessoriforeveryone.com/grammar-symbol-boxes-delightful-addition-classroom.html" >}}

5. Choose for or elicit from the students a naming word (a common noun) such as, chair.  Bring the chair to the rug. Name the object. Write the word on a slip of paper and remind them that the word itself reminds us of the object. Words stand for something and refer to them. “This is how language developed on earth many thousands of years ago- we all agree to call this a chair and write it this way: ‘chair.’   Now, we can remove the object, the chair and use the word card and we know what it means. It is a noun, chair, that refers to the thing we sit in, like that over there.”
6. Place the word on the rug. Since this is a noun, we can place a black triangle over the word. 
7. Show or write another word: table. Ask a child to take a black tringle from the grammar symbolizing box and place it above the noun card. 
8. Invite the child to symbolize more nouns.
9. Ask the child a question that will lead to an article, verb, or adjective lesson.

**For example:**
* Article (the vs. a / an) : How did you know which chair I was thinking of when you brought the object - “chair”  over to the rug? Then, proceed with the Article lesson.
* Verb : How did the chair get over here to the rug before?  You carried it over? “That is not a naming word is it? Let’s learn about those words that are actions. Then, proceed with the Verb lesson.
* Adjective: How did know not to bring over the observation chair? Then, proceed with the Adjective lesson.

**Variations & Extensions:**
* Collect objects from around the room that are nouns
* Move to verb, article and/or adjective lessons
NB: some people prefer to give the verb lesson as the first grammar lesson since it is so fun and different from other Children’s House language lessons.

### Article: a / an; the

**Prerequisites:** Reading with no image support CVC words, several phonograms and least puzzle words: the, an, a. 

**Direct Aim:**  Learn the names of the part of speech, the article

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for further lesson in grammar and syntax

**Vocabulary:** article, light blue, pyramid, 3D and 2D

**Age:**  	5+

**Control of Error:**  Teacher

**Points of Interest:** Grammar box and symbolizing words; ludic side of grammar lessons; peer/group work 

**Materials:** Small light blue pyramid & stand; grammar symbols (in 2D) box; strips of paper and pencil or articles printed and mounted on light blue paper. Be sure to have several of each, “an”; “a” and “the” written on slips of paper

**Presentation I:**
1. Invite a small group to the lesson
2. If the lesson is following the noun lesson, refer to the “chair,” or other object used in the lesson. How did you know which chair I was thinking about?
3. Let’s try again but this time, we are going to use pencils.
4. Tell them you are going to play a game to learn a new part of speech. It is the Definite Article game. 
5. Bring out the 4 new lead pencils (as similar as possible) 
6. Lay the group of 4 pencils out on the rug
7. Ask the children: May I have the pencil?
8. They will likely give you one. If they do, tell them you wanted a different one but hold on the first one.
9. Ask again, May I have the pencil? After then give it over, keep it but tell them you wanted a different one.
10. Do it a third time. Now there is only ONE pencil left.
11. Tell them you need to use words that better suit what you want. May I have the pencil?
12. Yes, That is the one I wanted.
13. Rule: when we have one specific object we are referring to, we use “the”
14. Rule: when we have a group, we use “a.” So if I don’t care what pencil you give me, I can say, May I have a pencil? If I want - definitely - a certain one - a certain pencil, I need to say, the pencil. 
15. The word “the” is called a definite article. 
16. “This word, article means ‘small’ here. It is a small word, but it matters which we use. It appears always with a noun, so it has the same shape.” Show the light blue pyramid. Then show them the 2 D light blue triangle. It is a small word, so we use a small pyramid. So, we say, the pencil, the chair, the girl when we have a definite thing or person in mind.

{{< figure class="white-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/language/image484.webp" caption="http://whatdidwedoallday.blogspot.com" >}}

17. The word “a” or “an” is called an indefinite article.  It too, also always appears with the noun. When any pencil, chair, girl will fit our needs, we use “a” or “an.” So, we say, a pencil, a chair, a girl when we DON’T have a definite noun in mind. It is Indefinite- “IN” means “not” here: not definite; any version of the noun will suffice. 
18. Using word cards (the/ a / an) or objects from the classroom, symbolize the words using the grammar symbols in 3D or 2D.
19. Invite the children to play the game of having a “definite noun” in mind.

**Presentation II:**
1. Do you know when to use the indefinite article “a” and when to use the indefinite article “an”?
2. Bring two small movable alphabets to the rug.

Write the words using the blue or alternating color of the initial vowel: pencil, box, apple, cube, insect, banana, ice cube, oval, etc. 
3. Read the words and ask if they can devise the rule.

**Variations & Extensions:** 
* Invite the student to combine the grammar lessons (noun and article)
* Invite them to use the Miniature environment
* Introduce the verb lesson

### Verb Lesson

**Prerequisites:** Reading with no image support CVC words, several phonograms and at least the puzzle words: the, an, a. 

**Direct Aim:**  Learn the names of the part of speech, the verb

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for further lesson in grammar and syntax

**Vocabulary:** verb, red sphere, 3D, and 2D

**Age:**  5+

**Control of Error:**  teacher

**Points of Interest:** Grammar box and symbolizing words; ludic (spontaneous, playful) side of grammar lessons; peer/group work 

**Materials:** Red sphere & stand; grammar symbols (in 2D) box; strips of paper and pencil or verbs printed and mounted on red paper. For using with the miniature environment, be sure to have verbs conjugated in the singular and plural such as “eats” (= 3rd person singular) and “eat” (=1st person singular or all plural), as well as past tense forms of the verb such as “ate,” “ran,” “swam.” Finally, make sure the verb cards are also in command form for the Verb Game. The Verb game often has a red circle “mat” made of red felt or foam. (The children act out the verb on the special red “mat”).

**Presentation:**
1. Invite a small group to the lesson
2. If the lesson is following the noun lesson, refer to the “chair,” or other object used in the lesson. How did the chair get over to the rug? You carried it? 
3. Carry: is that a naming word? Is it solid “thing”? A naming word is a person, place a thing: girl, school, pencil. Carry is not one of those. It is not a noun
4. “If it is not a noun, then we cannot have an article. The articles only come with nouns. No nouns, no articles!”
5. “Let’s look at our new symbol.” Pick up the red sphere. We know this is a sphere and it rolls. 
6. Invite the children to roll the red sphere around.  Explain that this symbol means action. “Carry” is an action. This part of speech is called a “verb.” 
7. Tell the children that you are going to play the Verb Game. 
8. Secretly, write a verb on paper such as “sing” on slip of paper [or take one of the pre-printed verb command cards printed on red paper] and hand it to a child. Whisper the word or have the child read the word on their own and then act out the word while on the verb mat. 
9. Ask the other children what the verb is. “Sing”-  “but it did not say ‘laugh!’” 😊

{{< figure class="white-outline float-left preview-300" src="/img/language/image486.webp" caption="https://www.blog.montessoriforeveryone.com/grammar-symbol-boxes-delightful-addition-classroom.html" >}}


10. Give the children another verb and ask them to act it out. For example, “jump.” Ask a child to act out the verb on the verb mat (see above materials). 
11.  Place the word cards in the rug: sing and jump. Invite the child to place a red circle above the word cards.
12. Invite the children to play this on their own.
13. Invite the children to create sentences with the Miniature environment. 

**Variations & Extensions:** 
* Invite the student to combine the grammar lessons (noun and article)
* Invite them to use the Miniature environment
* Introduce the verb lesson

### Adjective Lesson

**Prerequisites:** Reading with no image support CVC words, several phonograms and least puzzle words: the, an, a. 

**Direct Aim:**  Learn the names of the part of speech, the adjective 

**Indirect Aim:**  Prepare for further lesson in grammar and syntax

**Vocabulary:** adjective, pyramid, 3D and 2D

**Age:**  5+

**Control of Error:**  teacher

**Points of Interest:** Grammar box and symbolizing words; ludic side of grammar lessons; peer/group work 

**Materials:** Four pencils of different colors (different sizes can be handy for additional examples); mid-size dark blue pyramid & stand; grammar symbols (in 2D) box; strips of paper and pencil or articles printed and mounted on blue paper.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**  Grammar Symbols tray

{{< figure class="white-outline" src="/img/language/image488.webp" caption="https://www.nienhuis.com" >}}

Very often the grammar symbols are made by suppliers as above, with four pyramids. Many English-speaking teachers are confused by this fourth pyramid. This symbol refers to the determiner [el determinante in Spanish, le déterminant in French,) which is a part of speech in many languages. See: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determiner>

This is NOT used in English grammar lessons, yet it is used in many other languages because determiners must align with the number and gender of the noun that they are qualifying. Therefore, there can be many forms of the main determiner word. For example, in Spanish, for “my” can be mi or mis.  In English, we tend to categorize determiners as types of adjectives and in the example above, we classify “my” as a possessive adjective. The practice of designating these qualifying words as a separate part of speech, the determiner, is much more frequent in languages that have gendered nouns and singular and plural nouns forms. Their use is much more complex than it is in English. Thus, they have their own symbol in Montessori materials.

**Presentation:**
1. Invite a small group to the lesson
2. If the lesson is following the noun lesson, refer to the “chair,” or other object used in the lesson. How did you know that I did not want the observation chair? 
3. Let’s see how you know what I want. This time, we are going to use colored pencils.
4. Tell them you are going to play a game to learn a new part of speech. It is the Adjective game. 
5. Bring out 4 colored pencils.  
6. Lay the group of 4 pencils out on the rug
7. Ask the children: May I have the pencil?
8. They will likely give you one. If they do, tell them you wanted a different one but hold onto the first one.
9. Ask again, May I have the pencil? Keep the one they give you but tell them you wanted a different one.
10. Do it a third time. Now there is only ONE pencil left.
11. Tell them you need to use words that better suit what you want. May I have (the _____ (color))  pencil?
12. Yes, I wanted a _____  (color) pencil.
13. How did you know which one? Yes, I said the color in front of pencil: the red pencil. 
14. I described the pencil with a color word. This is called an adjective. 
15. Return all the pencils to the rug. Ask the students to use a describing word – an adjective and a noun and ask for a certain object. For example, give me the green pencil.

{{< figure class="white-outline float-right preview-300" src="/img/language/image490.webp" caption="https://www.maitrilearning.com/products/imperfect-grammar-step-3-adjective-2" >}}

16. Add a few more pencils of sizes and colors. Ask the children to listen carefully: Give me a small pencil. Give me the small brown pencil. Take the long red pencil. 
17. Show them the dark blue pyramid. Remind them that adjectives describe nouns and that that is why they are also represented by a pyramid. 
18. Show them the 2D dark blue triangle from the grammar symbol box.
19. Writing the words or using the existing noun cards (and article cards if already presented) compose some phrases such as “a small dog”; “ the tall man” and “a happy girl.”  Then, symbolize the words using the 2D shapes from the grammar symbols box.
20. Invite the children to play the game on their own and to use the Miniature environment to make phrases or sentences.

**Note:** A phrase is an article, noun, and possibly an adjective; a sentence: a noun phrase with a verb. i.e. The dog eats. FYI: Sentences can be as short as two words if a pronoun is used: She eats.

### Miniature environment with parts of speech

This can be a separate work that the child takes off the shelf and works on alone or with a partner. Or it can be a stationary miniature environment where the word cards are available for the students who are ready for grammar work.

Some students may do better working with large symbols and baskets of objects.

These large grammar symbols are made with stiff felt and can help struggling students better understand the abstract concept of parts of speech.

1 To show the complete array of long vowel sounds, this chart includes single vowels that can be long which are typically in the beginning of the word. However, we do not teach this as a phonogram- it is not a group of letters. We wait until the child is confident in detecting long and short sounds, naming them, and producing the correct sound and then we show them how sometimes a single vowel can be long by itself. Examples: long a with one letter: apron, agent, basic; long i with one letter: item, idea, iron; long o with one letter: oval, hotel etc. These can be taught as sight words as well.
2 The dash ( -) represents the interior vowel that appears with a final silent e. The  – stands for the consonant in between. This is also known as ‘magic e”. There are very few e-e words and even so, they do not follow the rule: ewe, for example. Thus, this e-e combination is not applicable. 
3 Included in Chart 1 are the long sounds of the single vowel which are typically in the beginning of the word. They are not usually in phonogram work, but they can be a separate lesson. Once the child easily detects and names long and short sounds within words, then they are ready for single vowel long sounds. Examples: long a: apron, agent, basic; long i: item, idea, iron; long o: oval, hotel; long e: he, she, we, be, me (can be coupled with WBH work).
 
4 This is the interior vowel with a final silent e, hence the – for the consonant in between. Also known as “magic e”. There are a few e-e words, but they do not follow the rule: ewe, for example.
